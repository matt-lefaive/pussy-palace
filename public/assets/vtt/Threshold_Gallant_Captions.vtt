00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:01.449
First you would go down a few stairs.

00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:02.960
Unfortunately, it was very inaccessible.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.540
You go down a few stairs, come in through
the door, and there was a little vestibule

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.040
and, you know, someone behind a glass window
who would take your ticket or your money to

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.620
buy a ticket, your ID.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.750
Then you’d be buzzed in.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.750
The door was locked.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.740
You could only get in once you were buzzed
in, which was no doubt security that gay men

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.720
needed to protect themselves.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.010
As an event organizer, there’s a lot of
stuff that has to happen around the entrance.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.000
So, what I remember is having a clipboard,
a headset where we would communicate with

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.899
other members of the team, my little pen,
and people in line.

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.640
And I would run around with my little clipboard
and my headset.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.480
I cannot believe I did that in heels, but
I probably did.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.480
Wow.

00:00:48.796 --> 00:00:51.789
Ugh. Yeah, no way now.

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:57.320
Everybody in the line also got a little spiel,
a little anti-oppression spiel on your way in,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.270
which I think included stuff around trans women.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:08.782
I think we were really trying, I don’t know
how successfully, to deal with the depth of

00:01:08.782 --> 00:01:15.540
trans misogyny in queer, cis women’s community,
which was very intense and just so horrible.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.990
So, that’s kinda what I remember most is
the buzz around the–.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.630
It’s kind of the ugly, industrial, vestibule
before you got into the sexy dance floor.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.850
Brightly lit.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.660
Seriously heavy steel door that only opens
by buzzer.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.070
The, like, shitty faded carpet that was everywhere.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.159
I remember that too because it is hard to
walk on carpet in high heels.

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:45.801
And then immediately on the other side of
it is, like, an illuminated bar and DJ Nik Red

00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:52.689
on the turntables and people on the dance
floor wearing a towel and nothing else.

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:54.860
And the buzzer, the door opening.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.850
You’re in or you’re out.
