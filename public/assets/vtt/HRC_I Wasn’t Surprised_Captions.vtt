When you look at policing, when you’re new to&nbsp;
it, the recommendations, like: they need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.080
live in the communities where they’re policing,&nbsp;
we need more queer people as police officers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.080
training is going to improve things, that’s&nbsp;
pretty typical for folks who are, kind of,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.280
new to thinking about this, and that was, by&nbsp;
and large, the feedback that I was getting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.680
And I’m not surprised because it was 2005.&nbsp;
I’d be surprised if I got the same feedback&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.400
now because I think people now understand&nbsp;
that actually it doesn’t really matter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.240
if more of them are queer. It doesn’t really&nbsp;
matter if they live in your neighbourhood or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.120
have training up the yin yang. It doesn’t really&nbsp;
matter. The recommendations around strip search,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.960
I was not surprised by that either, and they make&nbsp;
sense to me as a way going forward. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:57.600
trans-identified folks had many more actual&nbsp;
carceral experiences with police than the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.920
general public, so they weren’t speaking&nbsp;
theoretically. They were speaking, “Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.600
if you’re going to search me, it needs to happen&nbsp;
this way.” I mean, we were asking them, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.560
“What’s the best way to do this?” So, we weren’t&nbsp;
getting a lot of, “Don’t ever do it.” Right?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.080
There’s an acceptance on the part of the oppressed&nbsp;
that the oppression is going to keep happening,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:24.960
but I was happy that people were articulating that&nbsp;
any cavity search is a sexual assault because that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.680
needs to be said over, and over, and over again.&nbsp;
Like, strip searching inherently is assaultive;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.680
it’s sexual violence. That came out from what&nbsp;
people responded, and I’m glad that it did.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.760
And around the bar owner stuff, again, it was...&nbsp;
It’s all very practical. Very, “We accept that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.880
we need to be accountable to the Liquor Control&nbsp;
Board Act.” Those folks were pissed off, though,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.200
at the interference in their business because, you&nbsp;
know, I’m interpreting now, but they’re invested&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.640
in capitalism. They’re business owners, and&nbsp;
a lot of them aren’t even queer particularly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.400
and it’s like, “What the hell’s going on here?&nbsp;
Why is this happening to us?” Reading through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.520
the report, I was having to remind myself, this&nbsp;
is what people told you, Anna, so it’s not your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.360
opinion. And I’m trying to think, in 2005, what my&nbsp;
opinion would have been. I think I had an analysis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.000
at that point that more training isn’t going to&nbsp;
do it, and having more LGBTQ officers isn’t going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.560
to do it. I think that my analysis at that time&nbsp;
would have been more, for lack of a better word,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:36.000
radical. It would have been more on the&nbsp;
abolition... You know, towards that. Right?
