00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.880
Our bodies are sexualized bodies because our&nbsp;
melanin has been looked at a certain way and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:13.320
treated a certain way. It’s very clear to us now&nbsp;
that Black women’s bodies have been oversexualized&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.880
and over- treated with violence compared to other&nbsp;
bodies. Same with Indigenous bodies. And so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.760
when you move into sex from that angle of things,&nbsp;
of course the needs are different. We instituted a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.880
mini sort of talk, like a, “Hey, if you’re a white&nbsp;
person coming to the space or white identified,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.840
here’s the rundown of what it means to be a&nbsp;
white ally in the space.” There was definitely,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.200
like, orientation moments where at 9:30&nbsp;
p.m., you all gather here, if you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.120
a tour of the space or whatever. But in those&nbsp;
moments, people would also have to talk about,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.000
or work into conversations, the politics&nbsp;
of certain bodies being more “attractive”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.400
and more people flocking to certain kinds&nbsp;
of people than other kinds of people, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.200
what it meant to eroticize certain communities.&nbsp;
You know? Like... We had like a contract that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.600
people had to sign off on at the door. If you’re&nbsp;
a person of colour, you could just walk right in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.880
which is really interesting because I don’t think&nbsp;
we would do the same thing now. Right? Like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.240
doesn’t mean that lateral violence isn’t&nbsp;
happening. Doesn’t mean that I’m not being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.280
racist or anti-Indigenous as a brown woman or&nbsp;
whatever. So, it’s just interesting where we were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.840
at with some of the ways in which we were&nbsp;
trying to talk about race in those spaces.
