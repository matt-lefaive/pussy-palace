00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.620
I can remember being...

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.180
Not spending a lot of time on the dance floor
because it was always crowded, which is great.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.679
Like, I love a sweaty dance floor, don’t
get me wrong.

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:12.519
But it’s such a small dance floor, if I
remember correctly, and there was always other

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:13.589
things to do.

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:15.559
To hear afterwards, what was the estimated...?

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.490
Like, 350 people or something like that?

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.930
Like, I don’t know if it ever felt like
that, but there were definitely places that

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.762
were very congested.

00:00:24.762 --> 00:00:28.380
Lots of people coming and going, passing each
other.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.710
There was kind of a way of moving through
the space.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.050
Because there was always someone behind you
or in front of you.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.570
Unless you were in very particular places
in the space, you would have to stop traffic

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.170
to stop and linger.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.640
So, I remember that.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.840
That sense of having to go, “Okay, I’m
turning right here.”

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.309
There was always an underlying — in which
was my own projection, I’m sure — of anxiety.

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:52.579
Nervousness.

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.820
This idea of, “Who’s there?

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.079
Who’s seeing me?

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.550
Who am I seeing?”

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.719
Classic ex.

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:00.847
“Is my ex here?

00:01:00.847 --> 00:01:03.129
What’s going to happen if I see them?”

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:09.680
What I learned later about myself is that
even though I express myself outwardly, I’m

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.680
actually quite anxious.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.439
Like, I am a bit of an introvert.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.318
That extroverted introvert kind of idea.

00:01:16.318 --> 00:01:19.040
So, when I get anxious, I tend to get bigger.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.873
So, I have lots of memories of, like, the
next day going, “Oh my God, what did I say?

00:01:25.873 --> 00:01:27.673
What did I do?”

00:01:27.673 --> 00:01:34.602
So, the two biggest emotions: absolute joy
and freedom, and intense anxiety and nervousness.
