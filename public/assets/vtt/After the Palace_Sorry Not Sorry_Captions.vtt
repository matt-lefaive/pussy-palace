They asked us, some years later, to be part&nbsp;
of that apology letter that they issued to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.360
the community, and, you know, we refused to&nbsp;
participate when it became clear that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.240
weren’t willing to actually take action, they were&nbsp;
just willing to say more words. So, they weren’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.400
going to change anything structurally in terms&nbsp;
of policy, there was not even really a gesture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.680
towards that. And... [laughing] You know, they&nbsp;
issued the apology, and then there’s, like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.800
the Marie Curtis [Park] raids. [laughs] It was&nbsp;
just like, “Dude, this is why we said no.”

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.720
We were all sort of chatting on Facebook about our&nbsp;
experiences, and it didn’t really hit me what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.600
a collective trauma this was ’til I started&nbsp;
reading everybody sharing their stories about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.400
the horror of that night and what went down.&nbsp;
It’s all happening, right? And then it’s like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.360
“Oh wow, that really was a trauma that we went&nbsp;
through.” And it was quite something that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.080
organizers of the Pussy Palace told the cops to&nbsp;
go fuck themselves and what they could do with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.200
their apology. And they’re like, “Yeah, we don’t&nbsp;
want your stupid PR move. F-you. This is nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.320
This is meaningless.” And they were right. They&nbsp;
were totally right. Because even in the end,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.576
their “apology” for the raiding of the men’s&nbsp;
bathhouses was bullshit. It wasn’t an apology.
