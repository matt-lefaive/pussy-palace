00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.400
I feel like that happened later on, not right
from the beginning.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.900
It was the time in our queer community history
where it wasn’t taken for granted that trans

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.330
people would be part of who is included.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.900
That it was called the “Pussy” Palace
to start with…

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.620
Like, I already didn’t really feel connected
to that myself, but it was just understood

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.260
as sort of the queer women’s aesthetic.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.340
Like, cats are cool, and pussy is how we talk
about sexy things.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.920
So, that already has a very specific to flavour
to it.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:44.060
We had discussions of: How do we do trans
inclusive, women-specific spaces?

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.870
And how do we talk about this?

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.660
How do we talk about a space that basically
is saying, if you’re a cis-man, then you

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.730
shouldn’t come, but anybody else, really,
is welcome?
