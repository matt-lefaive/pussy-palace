00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.600
The late 90s early aughts...It wasn’t exactly
the best time to be a trans woman in the queer

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.600
women’s community.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.519
So, I was a little worried about some people
not being accepting.

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:19.575
I had expected to go do my shift and then
leave and not to enjoy myself.

00:00:19.575 --> 00:00:23.340
And after my shift, I actually had fun.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.797
The organizing committee, they were all very
welcoming.

00:00:26.797 --> 00:00:29.650
They made me feel like it was no big deal.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.020
I still, obviously, had all my own internalized
stuff, but coming from the organizing committee,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.750
it was quite welcoming.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.140
My understanding of the event was that it
was very explicitly welcoming.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.289
Inclusivity was not only said but meant.

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:46.720
I don’t think it was, like, lip service.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.320
That being said, I mean, I have to qualify
that, like, my body was acceptable there.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.680
So, I don’t know.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.551
Yeah, and again, I think I mentioned earlier,

00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:55.793
I was coming from being a worker at
Michigan [Womyn’s Music Festival],

00:00:55.793 --> 00:00:57.924
where there was a lot of constant

00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:00.315
battles around trans women

00:01:00.315 --> 00:01:01.690
being accepted there, and stuff like that.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.480
And, I mean, I’m on the side of trans women
are women, obviously, so...

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.180
I listened to, like, all of those bands.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.560
Like, Bikini Kill, Le Tigre.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.170
All of those fucking bands, I loved them.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.900
And, like, the idea of going to the [Michigan
Womyn’s Music] Festival was one of those

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.521
things that I just was aspiring to, 
and then finding out,

00:01:21.521 --> 00:01:24.110
nope, nope, nope, you’re not allowed.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.110
That was devastating.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.810
But then realizing as you have those conversations
with the queer women in your life, and them

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:39.270
actually defending that kind of decision,
suggesting that they thought that there was

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.700
a distinction between a “trans woman”
and a “real woman.”

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.950
That kind of breaks your heart.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.340
Because suddenly it comes 
hitting home fairly hard.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.290
I mean, at the first Pussy Palace and I believe
at the second, it was not uncommon to hear

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.549
women commenting on the presence of trans
women, myself included, in that space.

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.530
Asking, “Who let the boys in?”

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.620
You know, raising questions about — not
necessarily directly to me but in a way that

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.959
would very obviously be overheard — that
was about making plain that trans women were

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.490
not welcome in the space.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.077
You had very, very femme-presenting folk,

00:02:17.077 --> 00:02:19.393
and then you had very 
masculine-presenting folks.

00:02:19.393 --> 00:02:23.700
There were some trans guys there, more than
a few, but almost no trans women.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.700
Like, almost none.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.170
Like, I can’t remember running into any
trans women.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.090
In that respect, I felt a bit alone.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.060
I knew a fair number of genderqueer and transmasculine,
female-assigned persons who seemed to be navigating

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.300
the space with a certain amount of grace.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.750
But I saw a lot of trans women hanging out
by themselves.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.310
Or hanging out in pairs, in small groups,
but not interacting with either transmasculine

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.379
or cis patrons in that space.

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:55.730
So, I felt like the sense of isolation I had
was not uncommon.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.930
At previous Pussy Palaces, I’d felt a combination
of invisibility and hyper-visibility.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.920
Sexual invisibility.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.700
Hyper-visibility in terms of being a body
to be commented upon or to be scrutinized

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.663
and then dismissed.

00:03:10.663 --> 00:03:15.700
I’d been in queer women’s spaces, like,
kink spaces, play parties before.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.810
But a bar or a dungeon is so organized around
scenes, and they tend to be darker spaces,

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.090
and so I think in some ways one at the very
least is not attracting negative attention

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.390
through one’s presence.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.134
Whereas I think I felt quite exposed
in the bathhouse space,

00:03:31.134 --> 00:03:33.590
just by virtue of being visibly trans.
