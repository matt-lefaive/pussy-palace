00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.585
I see the pool as a deep turquoise colour,
lit from below.

00:00:06.585 --> 00:00:14.240
I see a lot of people kind of draped and hanging
out around the perimeter of the pool area,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.100
on benches.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:23.010
Some in the pool, some kind of parts of themselves
in the pool, but outside of the pool.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.550
People are in various states of dress and
undress.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:34.122
Someone’s walking by with a stack of towels,
trying to get back to the laundry room.

00:00:34.122 --> 00:00:39.980
The night is cool, and the sky is dark, and
there’s, like, a breeze.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.045
The water is warmish and is silky and soft.

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:48.433
And it’s just sort of...

00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:51.190
swishing, swishing around.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:58.728
There’s, like, faint music coming from inside
and it gets louder every time somebody opens the door.

00:00:58.728 --> 00:01:02.427
I keep hearing, like, ice in my glass.

00:01:02.427 --> 00:01:06.710
Although, I think we weren’t allowed to
drink on the patio.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.680
But that’s part of the feeling of having
a gin and tonic.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.049
It feels kind of misty, kind of foggy.

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.720
It feels magical, like a stolen summer night.
