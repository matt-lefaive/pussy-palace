00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.250
Back then, I had a lot of dysphoria about
my body.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.099
And so, it makes perfect sense now that I’ve
come out as a trans man, but I didn’t like

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.420
female bathing suits at all.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.500
So, the idea of going into the pool in a female
bathing suit was also something that I was

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.380
like, “How am I going to navigate this?”

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.130
I’d much rather be naked than wear a bathing
suit.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:31.179
I was spending a lot of energy trying to figure
out what to wear, and how to put myself together,

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:32.980
and how much stuff to bring.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.160
I know that I preferred to be nude in public.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.640
Like, in sex parties, that I preferred nudity.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.750
It’s kind of like Isadora Duncan talked
about.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.230
Full nudity is much less provocative than
only covering up a little.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.949
And I think I just felt more free and myself.

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.739
As myself as I could be when I was naked.

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.090
And so, I think I spent a lot of time in a
towel when it comes right down to it, with

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.129
like a bag of stuff.

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.100
I was much more free in these safer spaces
than I was in general.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.860
It was 2000.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.060
I was having to do temp work.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.347
I was having to basically put on a costume
to go to work and pretend to be, like, a corporate drone.

00:01:16.347 --> 00:01:21.159
And because I was an artist and an actor,
I sort of played the role.

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.710
And I always thought of myself almost like
a double agent.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.860
My clothes never felt like me.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.790
In that space, yeah, it was kind of like...

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.161
I could be powerful.

00:01:30.161 --> 00:01:32.400
Nobody’s asking like, “What’s your job?

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.670
What kind of car do you drive?”

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.030
It’s about who you are.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.260
It’s about who you express yourself to be.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.906
It’s about your connection with other people,
or at least that’s how I viewed it.
