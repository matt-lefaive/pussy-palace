It was a lot of white girls at the table all&nbsp;
talking very fast about what we could get done.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.640
There were some really powerful people of colour&nbsp;
who stepped up and said, “You’re not leaving us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.600
behind in this. We’re in at the beginning, not&nbsp;
in the middle, not at the end.” And that was the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:21.040
first time I saw that. That was when I started&nbsp;
to recognize another level of my privilege and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.120
realizing, “Yeah, why is everybody at this&nbsp;
table white?” And that was the beginning of,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.280
I think some of the really powerful voices that&nbsp;
come out in the women of colour in Toronto. That&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.320
you started seeing them stand up and go, “Hell no,&nbsp;
I want to be at this party as much as everybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.160
else. And I’ve been working for it, and I’m going&nbsp;
to continue to work for it.” So, that was a cool&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.800
part of my learning at that point was just who&nbsp;
the power players are and how hard they work.”
