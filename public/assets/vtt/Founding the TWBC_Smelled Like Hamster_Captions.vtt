00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:06.700
Club Toronto wasn’t the high end [laughing] 
of the men’s bathhouses.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.779
It was a wild space.

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:08.900
It smelled like a hamster cage.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.490
Like, every hallway ended in a mirror.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.490
It felt like a maze.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.650
There’s so many stairs at Club Toronto.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.650
Oh, my goodness.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.560
And that was a function of men’s bathhouses
that were more accessible being unwilling

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.560
to share space.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.070
Like, we ended up with a Thursday night at
Club Toronto because it’s the slowest night,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.640
and they weren’t making money anyway.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.660
And so, this was a way for them to make money.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.490
But at the places that probably had a steadier
income, or weren’t as reliant on an influx

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.620
of cash, were just not interested in sharing
space for a night with women.
