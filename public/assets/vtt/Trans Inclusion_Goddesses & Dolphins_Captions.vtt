I remember distinctly, and&nbsp;
it’s with great embarrassment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:10.840
that we had a discussion about trans women.&nbsp;
This was probably pre-2000. Our concern was,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.680
you know, “Are men going to start coming to&nbsp;
the event?,” kind of thing. So, I remember&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:25.480
saying this [groans]: “If you can put your dick&nbsp;
in a drawer, you can come.” Which is a horrible,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.880
horrible way to frame it, but that was sort of...&nbsp;
So, when I opened my store in 1997, it was really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.680
hard to find good quality silicone toys that&nbsp;
looked like penises. At the time they were all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.640
goddesses and dolphins and... Right? It couldn’t&nbsp;
look like a penis because this was seen as very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.120
male and the whole idea of that was rape. Right?&nbsp;
[coughs] That penetration was rape, but if it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:59.040
with a goddess, it was okay. [laughs] So, queer,&nbsp;
cisgendered women were, you know, using strap-ons,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:07.440
and so it was okay if you could take it off and&nbsp;
put it in a drawer, but that we were very much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.869
not trans women inclusive, and trans men were&nbsp;
not really on our radar at that point either.
