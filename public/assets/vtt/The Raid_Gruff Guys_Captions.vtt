00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.000
I just remember it being, like, so surreal.&nbsp;
Couldn’t kind of make sense of it at first.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.680
You’re like, “Is this really happening or is this&nbsp;
performance? Is this something that somebody’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.480
staging?” Or, you know, like, I just didn’t&nbsp;
know what was really happening. The last thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.080
I thought of was “police raid.” It just seemed so&nbsp;
bizarre. The thing I remember mostly is they were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.200
just very, like, gruff and very not conscientious&nbsp;
about what they were walking into. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.920
the whole thing kind of left a bad taste in my&nbsp;
mouth because I just thought that it was such&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.000
an unnecessary use of aggression and force,&nbsp;
and... I mean, but that’s my feeling with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.040
these types of things, whether it’s an all-female&nbsp;
event or any kind of private... I mean, public,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.240
but private, adult, permission-based&nbsp;
event where there was, like, nothing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.920
in my mind, harmful or illegal going on. Really,&nbsp;
ultimately, [laughing] one of the most harmless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.028
things you could do, and here we are, like,&nbsp;
raiding it. It just seemed ridiculous to me.
