00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.860
I would say, I mean, it was a relatively diverse
crowd in terms of queer lesbians.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.145
But then that’s not actually true.

00:00:07.145 --> 00:00:11.519
I’d say it was about 90% white, and then
10% people of colour.

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.240
It was a diversity of age.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.109
So, you had everything from baby queers all
the way up to…

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.670
Queer folk who are not baby queers.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.480
You had very femme-presenting folk, and then
you had very masculine-presenting folks.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.910
There were some trans guys there, more than
a few, but almost no trans women.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.960
Like, I can’t remember running into any
trans women.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.180
In that respect, I felt very alone.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.969
The trans men, they were really popular.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.910
Everyone wanted a piece of a trans guy back
then.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.829
Honestly, this feels bad to say, I almost,
kind of, traded on it.

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.892
Being a trans woman who presented in a masculine
way,

00:00:54.892 --> 00:00:58.238
sometimes I would be perceived as a trans guy.

00:00:58.238 --> 00:01:03.208
So, certainly, I have some insight into it
just because I was trading on it a bit.

00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:05.174
Highly unethical, I realize but...

00:01:05.174 --> 00:01:09.979
I really felt for a lot of trans men back
then, because there was a lot of erasure of

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.180
their identity in the queer women’s community,
and it kind of felt like some of that was

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.180
happening there.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.258
But at the same time, they seemed to be okay
with it, so...

00:01:19.258 --> 00:01:20.243
[laughs]

00:01:20.243 --> 00:01:23.329
There was a lot of exoticization happening.

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.264
I guess the best way to describe it is with
an old argument.

00:01:27.264 --> 00:01:33.790
I’m not going to express my opinion on it,
but the argument is, lesbian-identifying people

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.215
sleeping with trans men, and how that can
cause an erasure of identity.

00:01:39.215 --> 00:01:45.509
Because are they actually seeing the trans
men as men if they’re sitting there identifying

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.720
as lesbian?

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:54.290
Is this just a one-time thing, where you’re
like, “Ah pfft, I’m lesbian, but every

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.155
so often, I’ll sleep with a guy?” Or is
this like, “I really like trans guys,

00:01:59.155 --> 00:02:02.698
but I’m a lesbian because they’re not really
guys?”
