00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.433
I was in a private room. &nbsp;

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:36.779
What I recall is...

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:40.033
women running through the place,

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:41.700
shouting something like...

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.966
"Police are here!"

00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.682
"Police, police, police!"

00:00:44.682 --> 00:00:47.641
"Put your clothes on. Stop what you're doing."

00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:51.522
Whoever gave that first call, 

00:00:51.522 --> 00:00:55.357
everybody else would have turned around and shouted, "Police!"

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.045
Several times, volunteers dropped by...&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:00.162
The message was consistently,

00:01:00.162 --> 00:01:01.625
"there are still men in the building."

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:02.785
"The police are still here."

00:01:02.785 --> 00:01:03.886
"There are men in the building."

00:01:03.886 --> 00:01:07.661
I think that three, or so, people told us that, so...

00:01:07.661 --> 00:01:12.400
I also remember feeling kind of taken care of&nbsp;
by the the people who were running the event.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.702
And it's no different than what used to happen in&nbsp;
gay bars

00:01:19.702 --> 00:01:22.069
when being gay was illegal.

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:24.282
Light switches would flash.

00:01:24.282 --> 00:01:26.282
People would shout, "Police."

00:01:26.282 --> 00:01:27.880
And the men who were dancing with the men,

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.880
and the women who were dancing with the women

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.270
would quickly switch partners...

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.800
You know what? When the police come...

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.915
everybody participates in warning everybody.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.320
Being a volunteer I was just like, "I am on&nbsp;
top of whatever you need me to do."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.434
"Whatever you need right now, I am on it. Let's go."

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.960
A lot of people were really thrown off. It was&nbsp;
kind of like, "what?" So, there's a lot of people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.480
walking around just doing the reassuring. "Just&nbsp;
slow down. The organizers have got it."

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.840
"If you want to cover yourself up, that's fine, but there's&nbsp;
no need to leave. We're not doing anything wrong."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:17.840
Whenever it opened, as we were waiting in line,&nbsp;
they handed us these flyers letting us know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.509
heads up these things are illegal.

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:22.497
So, it was a good thing I was standing in line

00:02:22.497 --> 00:02:26.160
waiting forever because I did read the&nbsp;whole thing.
So when we did eventually get raided I...&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.400
because I read it there were certain things&nbsp;
that I was like, "oh, I read my pamphlet in line."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.920
"I don't have to open this door for this cop&nbsp;
banging on my door. I'm just gonna ignore him."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.107
It was like the aftermath of a tornado energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.107 --> 00:02:42.720
Some people were like, wide-eyed and quiet

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.187
and wandering alone.

00:02:44.187 --> 00:02:47.768
Other people were holding&nbsp;on to their friends

00:02:47.768 --> 00:02:49.768
and talking closely.

00:02:49.768 --> 00:02:52.392
Other people were...

00:02:52.392 --> 00:02:54.960
laughing really hard and

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.267
trying to continue their night.

00:02:57.267 --> 00:02:58.880
Brushing it off in almost a...

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.220
In an assertive way.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.226
I believe there was a time where

00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:08.302
there was like, consoling and comforting.

00:03:08.302 --> 00:03:11.673
Like, women obviously talking to each other.

00:03:11.673 --> 00:03:13.416
"What&nbsp;the hell just happened?"

00:03:13.416 --> 00:03:14.767
"Are you okay? How do you feel?"

00:03:14.767 --> 00:03:16.751
Like, there was... There was that.

00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:18.325
I have a memory of that.

00:03:19.508 --> 00:03:22.318
I went all over, everywhere, to check in.

00:03:22.318 --> 00:03:24.566
In every corner that I could at that point.

00:03:24.566 --> 00:03:26.164
People telling me...

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:29.442
"He stepped on someone's foot and ruined their shoe."

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.532
Someone else got knocked into.

00:03:32.532 --> 00:03:34.316
Some said they were laughed at.

00:03:34.316 --> 00:03:38.055
Two people were crying when we talked.

00:03:38.055 --> 00:03:41.380
We all gathered at the Temple and had a circle.

00:03:41.865 --> 00:03:43.865
I gave, you know, a lot of hugs.
