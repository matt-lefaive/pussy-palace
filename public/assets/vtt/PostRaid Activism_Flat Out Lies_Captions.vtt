00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.840
I went to every single day and every single&nbsp;
moment of the court case. This was the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:14.960
time I actually witnessed right in front of me&nbsp;
state intention to lie, to deceive, to gaslight...&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.162
The embedded misogyny, the homophobia, the&nbsp;
transphobia, the arrogance of the police...

00:00:22.162 --> 00:00:27.600
Again, because of the tone of the way the police had 
been&nbsp;talking about these things... Very much felt like,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.160
kind of, a moral panic of, “They’ve got to close&nbsp;
down these sex rooms in case someone unknowingly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.440
wandered in,” which was impossible. It was&nbsp;
made very clear that this was a sexual space,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.240
and that there was going to be naked people&nbsp;
and there was going to be sexual activity, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.849
you could not walk in there 
and be surprised by&nbsp;that.

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:48.720
The two people who had this liquor permit,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.080
I know one of them very well. This person will&nbsp;
not cross the street if there isn’t a light,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:01.760
a green light. They are a law-and-order person.&nbsp;
They shut down that bar before one o’clock. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.214
police lied. They lied that it was open after one&nbsp;
o’clock in the morning.

00:01:05.214 --> 00:01:06.320
 And I knew that that was

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.920
false because, number one, the male officers came&nbsp;
in before one o’clock in the morning. I’m pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.880
sure that last call was 1:00 a.m. at that time.&nbsp;
But I know that they absolutely were not serving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.449
beyond the legal hours.

00:01:19.449 --> 00:01:25.378
I think they had to come&nbsp;up with something because
they had to justify them coming into the space, 

00:01:25.378 --> 00:01:26.289
so they lied.

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.240
I feel&nbsp;like they were talking about specific scenes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.720
of sex that were happening in the bathhouse&nbsp;
that didn’t happen. Played it out like it was,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.160
like, Caligula. I don’t know what it was&nbsp;
specifically, but that was the feeling like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.720
“That is so not true. Absolutely did not happen.”&nbsp;
You know, I’ve watched enough television shows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.339
but this is real life. This is watching cops&nbsp;
lie, point blank, on the stand.

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:57.400
You know, I had grown up thinking that the police were 
on my&nbsp;side and they were a place to turn when I needed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.920
help, and it was that moment that I realized, not&nbsp;
necessarily, that they may also do harm, and I’m&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.760
really fortunate that I was in my late twenties&nbsp;
before I felt that knowledge, that I was part&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.480
of a community that I could not absolutely count&nbsp;
on the police helping me instead of harming me.
