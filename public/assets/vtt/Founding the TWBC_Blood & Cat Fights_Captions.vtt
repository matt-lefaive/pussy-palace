00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.396
We were approaching men’s bathhouses, and
they weren’t interested.

00:00:04.396 --> 00:00:05.560
They were like, “Nope, sorry.”

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.810
They didn’t want to turn away their clientele
for a night.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.710
So, we were having a really hard time getting
any positive response.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.010
And I remember we put together a petition
that we put out at Pride 1998.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.180
And we were getting people to sign it, to
say, “Look, we want to take over.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.580
Do you support this?”

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.880
And we were particularly trying to get cisgendered
men’s responses.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.879
Carlyle [Jansen] and I actually met with a
bathhouse owner at Club Toronto at the time.

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:35.219
And were very surprised.

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:42.757
Because we tried many...several other bathhouses
that just wouldn’t take us on, but he did.

00:00:42.757 --> 00:00:47.059
And the owners were actually really not sure
that this was going to…

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.829
Would there be 100 women?

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.760
I remember they had two particular concerns.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.070
[laughs] One was blood.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.120
When women have sex, there’s blood; how
are we going to clean the sheets?

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.180
[laughs] And the second was, how are we going
to deal with all the cat fights?

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.500
Because of course women are very territorial.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.290
And if they see somebody having sex with somebody
else, they’re going to end up in a big brawl,

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.860
and how are we going to deal with these?

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.369
So, we tried to reassure them [laughs] that
this wasn’t going to be an issue.

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.901
They were the most rundown of the bathhouses
at the time.

00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:27.460
The only thing they really had going for them
was the pool.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.510
So, they didn’t really have a lot to lose.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.439
And it was September, so it was getting colder,
so they were willing to give us a night.

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.570
And they had told all their staff, “You
have the night off.”

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.290
They didn’t really think anybody was going
to show up.
