00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.580
There was definitely space given for voyeurism.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.819
I was watching them.

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:13.643
I was interested in how they got people to
disarm and be comfortable in front of the camera.

00:00:13.643 --> 00:00:20.619
There was something really amazing about watching
people pose and take up that kind of space

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.619
and that it was okay to do.

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.660
You know, growing up having been socialized
female, that we’re not allowed to do that,

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.682
we’re not supposed to do that.

00:00:30.682 --> 00:00:35.051
People being really interested and engaged
in showing off was wonderful.

00:00:35.051 --> 00:00:41.250
Well, the possibility that it could be there
was definitely capturing for posterity that

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.720
this event definitely happened.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.280
Because I think we weren’t allowed to take
photos just randomly because of privacy issues.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.449
So, that was a space where it could be recorded,
and I think people really liked that and gravitated

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.226
there to create the images.

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:07.780
Like, all through the 80s and 90s there was
a lack of any kind of sexuality for women

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.130
and trans people.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.900
Like, there was nothing out there.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:18.570
We were not seeing images of any kind of female
sexuality or women’s sexuality, and there

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.220
was a need for that.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.185
There still wasn’t enough imagery out there
to actually feel like you belonged anywhere.

00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:33.189
So, there was this kind of idea that, “Oh,
well, we have to create this imagery, otherwise

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.205
it’s not going to be there for anybody later.”
