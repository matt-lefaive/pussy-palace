00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.745
At that left end of the room is all kinds
of toys.

00:00:03.745 --> 00:00:10.879
So, paddle benches and a St. Andrew’s cross
and a few other accoutrements.

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:16.779
It’s not big room, probably no more than
15 by 20, but you can bet there’s got to

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.650
be 30 to 35 people in that room.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.569
So, it’s quite congested, but even within
the congestion, they’re making space for each other.

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:26.800
Like, everybody’s smiling.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.400
There’s people standing in the doorway,
looking in, trying to get a peek at what’s

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.400
going on.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.800
The body heat in the place is just cranking
up.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.550
It’s got to be 78 to 80 degrees in there,
and people are peeling off clothes to accommodate

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.340
the warmth and each other.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.998
The different shaped bodies, it’s like an
array of colours, and ethnicities, and sizes,

00:00:48.998 --> 00:00:51.144
and activities.

00:00:51.144 --> 00:00:55.520
And you’re just kind of standing there thinking,
“Wow, this is what it’s supposed to be

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.760
like to go have fun without shame and without
any kind of bodily judgment.”

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.118
And just, just fucking have fun.

00:01:05.118 --> 00:01:07.869
And you know, all of the sounds of sex.

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:14.280
Flesh thumping against flesh, and the kind
of squeegee wet sounds, and the little teeny

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.390
sounds of people coming and then the great
big sounds of people coming.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.189
And then, the people who are on that edge,
who can’t quite get to it and there’s

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.780
that kind of tremor of waiting to go over
the edge.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.293
It’s pure joy.

00:01:28.293 --> 00:01:29.253
Pure joy.

00:01:29.253 --> 00:01:32.409
I think there’s that moment when you’re
in that space when you’re with somebody

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:33.869
where you’re just...

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.760
Your naked skin is touching their naked skin,
and it just feels like the peak of humanity.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.625
That moment, it’s divine.

00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:46.750
You’re connected at a deeper level, and
you’re just in a...

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.129
It’s hard to describe.

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:54.204
I remember coming out of Pussy Palaces thinking,
I had such gratitude.

00:01:54.204 --> 00:01:55.882
You know, I was exhausted.

00:01:55.882 --> 00:02:02.560
I was kind of used and used up, and fatigued
and dazed from the hours.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.210
Like, you would be there for seven and eight
hours straight, and you’d come out just

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.190
rung out, but stupefying-ly joyful.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.109
You couldn’t say thank you enough to the
organizers.
