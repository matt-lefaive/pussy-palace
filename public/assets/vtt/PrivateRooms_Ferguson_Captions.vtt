00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
People are standing in the hall talking.&nbsp;
People are in the next room having sex.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.420
And people from the room are yelling out, “Does&nbsp;
anybody have lube?” And three bottles of lube go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.980
in like bombs because it’s like, “Oh you need&nbsp;
lube? Here, have lube.” It’s social. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.340
I know the guys that go to the bathhouse&nbsp;
all the time. They never talk to anybody,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.940
they never look anybody in the eye, they&nbsp;
don’t know anybody’s name, and they would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.860
not interact with each other. And it’s like,&nbsp;
“Oh hell.” We’re here, we’re going to talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.340
in the stairwell. We’re going to be standing in&nbsp;
the kitchen gabbing about stuff while somebody’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.431
boiling a dick in a bowl to get it clean for&nbsp;
the next player. It’s way more communal.

00:00:34.431 --> 00:00:38.520
And it’s just like, “Wow, this is great. Can we&nbsp;
live here? Take the place over permanently?”
