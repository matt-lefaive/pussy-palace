00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.710
In 2000, Polaroids made a huge comeback because
no one had phones.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.049
And so, they reissued the Polaroid.

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.800
And, like, they became, like, the queer...

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.130
Everyone had them on their fridges.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.170
And so, it was like, “Oh, this is a perfect
solution to the problem of...

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.500
How could I do this?

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.289
Would I take people’s names and then develop
the film and get them photographs?”

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.289
And that didn’t make sense.

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.950
And so, then it was like, this Polaroid idea
came up.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.599
And to me, it was just perfect because, yeah,
it was instantaneous.

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.439
It eliminated issues around consent because
they would walk out the door with it.

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.460
I mean, sometimes I wouldn’t even see the
photo.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.300
Like, sometimes they’d walk away before
it developed.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.211
I mean, often they’d stay because they’d
be excited to look at it with me, and we’d

00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:41.230
look at it and then they’d, you know, they’d
leave.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.430
But it was just perfect.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.800
And the aesthetic was awesome.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.010
Like, Polaroids are just sexy.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.350
You can’t take anything with a Polaroid
and it doesn’t look sexy.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.129
Like, it felt like art to people.

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.180
It was about the image, but it was also the
process, right?

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.461
Like, it felt like every time someone came
in, we were doing relational art together.

00:00:56.461 --> 00:00:59.020
We were doing this performance art kind of
thing where...

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.329
Like, okay, so groups would come, you know,
couples would come, and then people would

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.828
come with one person then come back with a
different person.

00:01:06.828 --> 00:01:12.440
You know, I had trans women come who had never
been photographed as women, and who spoke

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.610
about this experience and sort of wanted to
be photographed in very particular ways.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.497
So, some people would come and really want
a very particular experience of seeing themselves represented.

00:01:24.497 --> 00:01:26.530
Other people were just like, “I don’t
know what to do.”

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.939
You know, they were very shy, and so I would
say, “Well, just...

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:30.939
I don’t know, have fun.”

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.220
Like, if they were with someone, I was like,
“Just make out, and I’ll take a good photo

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.604
and figure out how to…”

00:01:36.604 --> 00:01:38.626
I mean, weirdly I think it was kind of therapeutic.

00:01:38.626 --> 00:01:44.135
Like, it was this kind of interesting experience,
where people used it for a lot of different reasons.

00:01:44.135 --> 00:01:49.515
Most people wanted the door closed, but then
some people loved the idea of the door being open.

00:01:49.515 --> 00:01:51.630
If there was a line-up, people would watch
each other.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.899
I mean, it was just fun.

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.130
And then, you know, like, I once had someone...

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.079
She was like, “Well, I don’t want my picture
taken, but I want to take your picture.”

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.503
So that’s actually one of the only ones
I have, is I have a picture of me.

00:02:01.503 --> 00:02:02.640
She didn’t want to keep it.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.590
So, I think the aesthetic was really cool
and interesting.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.190
The immediacy of it was really wonderful.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.770
And it meant that the, like, the experience
completed itself right in that moment and

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.234
could be shared, both with me, but with others
and...

00:02:17.234 --> 00:02:21.897
Like, people would not have been willing to
do it, if they couldn’t walk away with that image.

00:02:21.897 --> 00:02:25.959
Like, they knew that I wasn’t, you know,
that I wouldn’t be keeping anything of them.

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.410
So, I think that was very important.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.920
I wish, I mean, now I’m like, “Oh my God,
I wish we had all those pictures.”

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.910
Because it would be such a great collection
of photos.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.310
But, you know, that’s the nature of it.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.310
It’s, like, ephemeral.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.950
It disappears.
