00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
I was experimenting with what it&nbsp;
would feel like to be sexualized&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:15.360
on terms that are mine. My early life&nbsp;
was the opposite of that. I felt, like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:24.420
zero sexualization as a “not out” but “out”&nbsp;
just because of how I looked, ostracized,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.980
freak of nature. And I identify as someone who&nbsp;
was, like, sexually curious very early. And so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.740
it felt like I had been waiting for, like,&nbsp;
two decades to be a sexual person. And so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:44.400
I had a lot of catching up to do. I really&nbsp;
wanted to be seen as desirable. And so, I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:54.120
was experimenting with: What does it mean to be a&nbsp;
sexualizable, to be a desirable, person? And then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.840
I was also having fun. And so, I really saw the&nbsp;
bathhouse as, like, a fun place where, like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:09.600
anything goes. And if I want to wear a rubber duck&nbsp;
on my head, then that’s great. The more I was a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.000
part of organizing it, the more freedom I felt to&nbsp;
say, “This is my house. So, I can be how I want.”
