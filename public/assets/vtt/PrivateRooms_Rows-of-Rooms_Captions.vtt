00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.830
The upper floors were more, like, mirrored
hallways and then, like, the tiny little rooms

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.839
with the, like, plastic-covered beds.

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.360
They had these rooms that seemed like it was
rows.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.210
Rows of rooms with beds, almost army style
or something.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.000
You know, like, little bed and mattress.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.341
And the doors did not…

00:00:18.341 --> 00:00:20.170
They weren’t floor to ceiling doors.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.270
They had, like, room on top and maybe on the
bottom.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.820
And you had to get there early to get the
best rooms.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.245
Because if you didn’t, you didn’t get
a room.

00:00:29.245 --> 00:00:32.757
I mean, a room was better than no room.

00:00:32.757 --> 00:00:37.490
And people were, you know, using those rooms
to have…

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.160
It seemed like mostly sex going on there.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.700
A room was a place you could invite people
to come and play with you.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.190
You know, if you wanted privacy.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.730
You could also go hide in a room and just
close the door, and listen to what was going

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.940
on all around you.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.290
Or you could invite someone in.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.774
I mean, there were monogamous couples who
went to these parties, and, you know, they’d go

00:01:00.774 --> 00:01:07.000
in a room together and they’d do whatever
they felt like doing in that room, and just enjoy.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.500
You know?

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.080
Or they’d do whatever they felt like doing
out in the open, and they remained monogamous.
