00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.240
The fallout from the raid, I think, is really&nbsp;
important. For a lot of women, it took a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.264
courage. After the raid, there were so many women&nbsp;
who just weren’t going to go again.

00:00:11.264 --> 00:00:15.135
Who knows what trauma people have experienced
at the hands of&nbsp;cops, right? Like...

00:00:15.135 --> 00:00:16.419
Or just men? You know, you

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:21.320
think you’re in this really awesome, safe space,&nbsp;
and to have that stripped away that quickly... It&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.161
was brutal to watch people’s faces and bodies just&nbsp;
shrink in on themselves.

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:29.087
We had to do a lot of&nbsp;work

00:00:29.087 --> 00:00:35.240
to try and make people feel comfortable about&nbsp;
coming back. And so, our numbers really dwindled,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.720
people didn’t feel safe. We knew that a lot of&nbsp;
people who’d been in conflict with the law or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.040
could be at conflict with the law — so, racialized&nbsp;
people, trans people, sex workers — it wasn’t as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.186
much of a safe space for them anymore

00:00:50.186 --> 00:00:52.211
because&nbsp;you never know when the 
cops are going to come&nbsp;back.

00:00:52.211 --> 00:01:00.880
I think it felt like what we wanted, our&nbsp;
desires, our identities, our sexual liberation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.360
was not okay. Definitely affected me. I would&nbsp;
guess that it affected other people in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.200
sense of it’s just another form of bullying and&nbsp;
a profound one because you’re just being told,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.431
“Oh, yeah? You think you can create this&nbsp;
beautiful, wonderful thing? Nah.”

00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:19.511
It was all so enraging.

00:01:19.511 --> 00:01:23.080
The differential impacts, the&nbsp;knowledge that 
that was happening across the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:30.080
board for a whole bunch of people who committed&nbsp;
no crime, but for a night out had their lives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.280
upended in this way. And of no consequence to the&nbsp;
police, community safety, the broader society,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.240
even a deeper moral fabric. There is, like,&nbsp;
no consequence in this event to anyone else,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.640
but that folks were going to have their&nbsp;
lives upended. You know, in many cases,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.024
completely redirected from paths&nbsp;
they would’ve otherwise pursued.
