00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.440
Training police is like moving a beach with a&nbsp;
teaspoon. I recognize it for what it is, it’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.160
one intervention. [laughing] It’s not like, “And&nbsp;
then it was fixed!” But they were forced to change&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.770
their policies around the search 
and detention&nbsp;of trans people.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.258
I suppose I kept thinking,

00:00:16.258 --> 00:00:22.545
the next trans woman to be arrested, hopefully
she’ll&nbsp;be treated well, and respected.

00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:25.506
You know, even if&nbsp;&nbsp;that made a slim 
difference for a second, 

00:00:25.506 --> 00:00:28.596
it was,&nbsp;you know, worth every second of this bullshit.

00:00:28.596 --> 00:00:34.506
If it fixed something for one person and made 
their&nbsp;life a little bit easier in contact with the&nbsp;police,

00:00:34.506 --> 00:00:36.861
that would have been worth every single&nbsp;
thing that we had to go through.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:38.489
Realistically speaking,

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.840
the only thing we can do is influence&nbsp;these 
really flawed institutions to, kind of,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.760
do things a little bit better. Because I can’t see&nbsp;
in my lifetime police being dismantled. I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.440
we all felt that horribleness, that we were almost&nbsp;
defeated before we started. Because inside we were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.040
saying, “No matter what we do, [laughs] no matter&nbsp;
how many minds we change, it’s still the structure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.288
that exists that’s meant to control other&nbsp;
people’s behaviours and other people’s actions.”
