00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
I had a particular look at that time. It was&nbsp;
very of that time, maybe a little past that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:16.457
It was very raver, so I had these huge, huge&nbsp;
pants with, like, these 23-inch bells on each&nbsp;leg.&nbsp;

00:00:16.457 --> 00:00:20.700
Amazing. They were men’s pants, and I&nbsp;
would wear them with a really tight tank top,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:29.176
and usually a military shirt or jacket on top. And&nbsp;
probably a military cap with an anarchist symbol&nbsp;on it.

00:00:29.176 --> 00:00:35.520
When I wore that outfit, it felt safer to&nbsp;
be in queer women’s spaces with a more masculine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:43.320
presentation because it made it harder for me&nbsp;
to be gauged as trans by people. So, I would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.542
often take on a more masculine presentation&nbsp;
so that people didn’t… “Oh, trans woman.”
