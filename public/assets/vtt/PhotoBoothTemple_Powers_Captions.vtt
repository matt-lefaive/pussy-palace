00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.679
Within 10 minutes of it opening, I was there
[laughs], for sure.

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:11.264
And so, I’d trolley in with my suitcase
and connect with the people who were working there,

00:00:11.264 --> 00:00:15.130
told them I was upstairs when they
had their break before everything opened up.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.040
I’d go in, close the door, put my hands
on all the walls.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.280
Take time.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.220
Orient myself in terms of the directions and
set everything up.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.251
And then I would open as soon as I could.

00:00:27.251 --> 00:00:34.470
I had, like, a yoga mat, and water and juice
and things to kind of help people if they needed it.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.720
And then, always had a shelf or something
— sometimes I would call it an altar — and

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:48.297
just have earth, air, fire, and water represented,
as well as, sort of, sensual things.

00:00:48.297 --> 00:00:53.878
Things that you could use in, like, a small
sex ritual, like this thread.

00:00:53.878 --> 00:00:58.140
So, if someone has a feeling or an understanding,
and they want to break a thread, or they want

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.629
to tie it around their ankle to remind themselves
of what they promised with me.

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.400
Tools, just physical tools.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.720
My softest flogger.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.860
And then I would hand-make paper, so people
could, like, write things down for themselves,

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.140
or I would write an affirmation, that sort
of thing that would help.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:24.200
My smallest mirror [laughs], so people could
look at themselves when they were saying things

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.380
for themselves and feel more grounded.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.004
The surface of the water, or a mirror, was
one of the oldest tools that practitioners have used.

00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:41.208
Try to weave that in for femmes and for people
to be able to help themselves when they’re

00:01:41.208 --> 00:01:43.022
dissociative, for example.

00:01:43.022 --> 00:01:46.498
Sometimes I would offer things.

00:01:46.498 --> 00:01:48.150
Like, give a Five-Fold Kiss.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.639
It’s a pagan term.

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:52.170
And I’d kiss the feet.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.049
You kiss the crotch area.

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.300
Kiss the chest, the mouth and the forehead.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:05.371
It was a way to just help someone feel good
and protected, or comfortable enough to ask for more.

00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:10.689
If someone was shy, I could offer a back hug,
so stand back-to-back.

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:16.680
Sometimes I would ask permission to take off
their shoes, and do that slowly and carefully

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.860
while listening.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.560
Lightly hold their feet.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.294
Touch pressure points in their feet.

00:02:22.294 --> 00:02:25.775
Hold their ankles, you know, and talk about
grounding.

00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:28.490
Sometimes someone would just come in and,
like, get right on the bed.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.050
“I really need to try this.”

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.266
Or they would just start taking their clothes off.

00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:34.410
Like, you just never know.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.490
So, often people would come to the temple
and, like, one person was really, really excited,

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.934
and the other person was, like, excited-scared.

00:02:42.934 --> 00:02:45.923
[laughs] Or like, more anxiety, right? Like...

00:02:45.923 --> 00:02:52.900
And trying to figure out safe ways to open
to possibilities there, but with enough rules

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.556
and safety established.

00:02:54.556 --> 00:02:56.290
Trying to figure out how to negotiate that.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.129
So, a couple would come to me and be like,
“This one’s excited.

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.420
This one’s a little scared.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.269
Here’s what’s going on with our bodies.

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:03.330
What can we do?”

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.940
So, then I would do something where I might
have them touch each other like this.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.549
Put a cloth over and around their hands so
they could look each other in the eye and

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.330
breathe, and say the most sweet and wonderful
compliments to each other about who they are

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.629
in each other’s lives.

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:27.030
And then being able to say, “This is what
I wish for you on your time alone tonight.”

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:34.799
And then being able to hold them and initiate
sexual contact for each of them, with me and

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:41.196
through me, so that their times at the temple,
it didn’t just feel like it was, like, the first time.

00:03:41.196 --> 00:03:48.216
So, even though there was, like, sometimes
pretty big line-ups, I'd try not to worry about them.

00:03:48.216 --> 00:03:52.060
The point was to feel like we had as much
time as we needed.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.000
Luckily, there was a double bed, even.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.250
I was the one with the double bed.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.250
I was really...

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.611
It’s the only double bed in the whole place.
