The workshop that we developed, I mean,&nbsp;
it was pretty good. It was... It was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.920
basically around the definitions&nbsp;
of the alphabet soup, the acronym,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.320
that’s how we would start. The one that&nbsp;
police seemed the most unfamiliar with was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.840
the “T.” They were okay with the LGB because&nbsp;
they kind of understood sexual orientation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.240
and of course by this time Ellen [DeGeneres]&nbsp;
had come out of the closet. [laughs] There were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.760
visible representations on TV. However, they were&nbsp;
unfamiliar with trans and gender identity issues,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.520
and what the relationship was between sexual&nbsp;
orientation and gender identity. So, as a result,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.339
a lot of the discussion of the 
workshops focused&nbsp;on trans issues.

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:45.640
The cops would have to introduce

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.640
the strip search policy part. [laughs] There were&nbsp;
some really interesting reactions. Invariably,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:00.840
some male cop would say, “What if there’s&nbsp;
this six-foot biker that says they’re trans,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.680
and says they’re a woman, and then they want to&nbsp;
be searched by a female officer, and, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.240
she’s just this little female officer, and da,&nbsp;
da, da, da, da.” And this came up, I kid you not,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.356
probably no less than three quarters of the time&nbsp;
I did this, that I was a facilitator for this&nbsp;training.&nbsp;

00:01:17.356 --> 00:01:20.400
You know, that was some of the more&nbsp;
benign stuff that you would hear, right? Like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.280
the worst is what you would hear from LGBT cops&nbsp;
when the workshop was over, and they would come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.640
and talk to you. You know, listening to people’s&nbsp;
pain and trauma, like, on their job. It’s just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.920
like... I’m not a big fan of police service in&nbsp;
the way that it’s run, and the lack of community&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.720
integration and responsible accountability. But&nbsp;
I felt for some of these folks, for sure. Because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.113
what they thought they were getting into, and&nbsp;
what they got into, were very different systems.
