00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.380
As people arrived, we would warmly welcome them&nbsp;
and tell them the lay of the land. I think there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.940
were other volunteers who were, sort of, greeters&nbsp;
once they were buzzed in the door. So, I think we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.960
just sort of took the tickets, introduced them&nbsp;
to a host-type volunteer, and then we were also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.100
the nerve central. If there was any issue, all&nbsp;
the information flowed through there. We had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.700
walkie-talkies, I think. You know, if they needed&nbsp;
something in one place, they would let us know and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.900
we’d pass on the message. So, communications,&nbsp;
I guess. I think I was excited and a bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.540
nervous about doing a good job as a volunteer, or&nbsp;
whatever. I know what shoes I would have worn. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:54.060
had these great, silver, platform boots. And then&nbsp;
probably, like, knee socks and a mini skirt. Oh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:01.680
yeah. And then I think maybe a bra and a little&nbsp;
sort of lacy thing. And I would have worn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:10.680
lipstick, which I don’t usually. Like an orange-y&nbsp;
red. [laughs] Definitely just feeling sexy and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.867
sexually, sort of, powerful. Communicating&nbsp;
confidence and interest in connecting,&nbsp;I guess.&nbsp;

00:01:17.867 --> 00:01:24.900
The term sexual liberation comes to mind.&nbsp;
It felt very taboo to get a bunch of women in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:32.506
space to get sexy together and connect. Sort of&nbsp;
scary and thrilling and exciting all at the same&nbsp;time.&nbsp;

00:01:32.506 --> 00:01:39.660
I had, in the 90s, been involved with AIDS&nbsp;
Action Now, with gay friends. I was aware of men’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:46.680
bathhouses and how gay men just seemed to have sex&nbsp;
with each other all the time, and that we could do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.580
that too… It actually, I feel like it opened up&nbsp;
new possibilities for myself and just what it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.300
could mean to be a dyke or a queer woman. That&nbsp;
we could be playful and adventurous, sexually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:07.380
in sort of uncommitted or transitory ways, was…&nbsp;
Like, I don’t think I would have come up with it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.680
myself if the event hadn’t been there to provoke&nbsp;
me to think, “Oh, I could do that.” You know?
