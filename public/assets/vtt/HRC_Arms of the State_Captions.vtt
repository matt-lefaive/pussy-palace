00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:07.080
TPAC began in 2000. John Sewell is, sort of,&nbsp;
the coordinator of it and was bringing people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.360
together, not because of the Pussy Palace.&nbsp;
That was one of many egregious and awful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.360
things that police had been doing. I had been a&nbsp;
member of another group called the Committee to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.600
Stop Targeted Policing in the late 90s, and we&nbsp;
were organizing around the targeting of homeless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.120
people in parks. It was an initiative that they&nbsp;
called “Community Action Policing.” It involved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.080
cops in little gangs, frankly, of four or five,&nbsp;
kind of, wandering... Going through parks in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.680
targeted neighbourhoods, which are always the same&nbsp;
neighbourhoods — Black, low-income, racialized&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.120
neighbourhoods — targeting people. “Why are you&nbsp;
here? What are you doing?” That was happening in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.520
the late 90s. Their budget continued to grow and&nbsp;
to grow and to grow. And when crime goes down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.040
they invent things for themselves to do. Hence the&nbsp;
“Community Action Policing,” and on, and on. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.280
there was lots going on, and this was just yet&nbsp;
more of. I think [Julian] Fantino was the chief&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.240
then. I mean, a horrible, horrible person and&nbsp;
police chief, and he had a history, as you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.920
of targeting gay men in London, Ontario back in&nbsp;
the day. And then this happens. That can’t be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.520
unrelated, the fact that cops felt emboldened to&nbsp;
go in and raid this lesbian and trans bathhouse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.960
you know, once he became chief. But for&nbsp;
most of us who had been around and been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.040
involved in politics in Toronto for any&nbsp;
length of time, this was not surprising,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.720
but it was enraging. Don’t forget, this&nbsp;
is the time of Mike Harris and horrible,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.600
horrible oppression of poor people and homeless&nbsp;
people. And the police were increasingly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.280
increasingly used as an arm of the state. I mean,&nbsp;
they always have been. Again, this is not news&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.640
to Indigenous people, certainly, not news to most&nbsp;
Black folks in the city, but for a lot of people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.440
it was a growing realization and just a cementing&nbsp;
of the fact that the police are… Their purpose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.840
was to uphold the state and to act, you know,&nbsp;
absolutely unaccountably without any checks and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.640
balances. And when you do that to people,&nbsp;
you’re going to get more uprising. If you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.760
marginalize folks so that they have nothing&nbsp;
left to lose, then they will act like they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.480
have nothing left to lose. Often that gets turned&nbsp;
in towards themselves and their own communities,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.160
but it will also get aimed outwards, and what do&nbsp;
you need then? You need a heavier-handed police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.320
force to keep that under control, and it just...&nbsp;
I think, though, for people, this was shocking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.158
in that it was so egregious. “Why? Why would you&nbsp;
do that?” Right, like, it was because they could.
