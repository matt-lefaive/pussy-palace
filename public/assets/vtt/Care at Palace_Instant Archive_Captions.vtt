00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.800
It was about the image, but it was also the&nbsp;
process, right? Like, it felt like every time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.480
someone came in, we were doing relational art&nbsp;
together. We were doing this performance art&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.240
kind of thing where... Like, okay, so groups&nbsp;
would come, you know, couples would come,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.560
and then people would come with one person then&nbsp;
come back with a different person. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.400
I had trans women come who had never been&nbsp;
photographed as women, and who spoke about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.480
this experience and, sort of, wanted to be&nbsp;
photographed in very particular ways. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.080
some people would come and really want a very&nbsp;
particular experience of seeing themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.760
represented. Other people were just like, “I don’t&nbsp;
know what to do.” You know, they were very shy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.240
and so I would say, “Well, just... I don’t know,&nbsp;
have fun.” Like, if they were with someone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.440
I was like, “Just make out, and I’ll take a&nbsp;
good photo and figure out how to...” I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.560
weirdly I think it was kind of therapeutic.&nbsp;
Like, it was this kind of interesting experience,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.760
where people used it for a lot of different&nbsp;
reasons. I mean now I feel like we take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.440
photos of every fucking thing all the time.&nbsp;
Like, it’s just like... But then we didn’t.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.040
We did not have cell phones. So, having&nbsp;
a photo of yourself was actually, like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.000
kind of a big deal. And for a lot of queers who&nbsp;
aren’t necessarily connected to their families of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.200
origin, or don’t necessarily have those kinds of&nbsp;
archives, like... Or they might have archives of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.200
themselves that feel totally inauthentic,&nbsp;
or not representative of who they are,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:26.040
I think having a photo was really awesome. To&nbsp;
have a photo of themselves in a place that felt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.513
authentic. What they chose to wear out to an&nbsp;
event like that. I think it was pretty great.
