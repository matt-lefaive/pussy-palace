00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.815
I remember there was one flyer.

00:00:02.815 --> 00:00:07.650
I remember Loralee [Gillis] coordinated it,
and she got all people, and it was a whole

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.090
bunch of people in an orgy scene, but you
couldn't see faces and stuff.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.104
And they were all people of color and/or trans
identified.

00:00:16.104 --> 00:00:21.930
So, we really tried to make it clear that
everybody was welcome and have the representation

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.084
so that everyone knew that they were welcome.

00:00:25.084 --> 00:00:33.829
There is a torso of a light-skinned woman,
seen — torso, ass, upper thighs — in a

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:43.280
bikini and bralette, being held at the hips
by a Black feminine person’s hands and forearms,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.252
and they are wearing leather cuffs with links
for suspension or bondage of some sort or another.

00:00:50.252 --> 00:00:56.671
It’s a black and white photo, and both figures
are anonymous, largely anonymous.

00:00:56.671 --> 00:01:00.480
And in this case, the woman is me.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.560
The light-skinned woman is myself, and it
is not necessarily apparent that I am trans

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.930
in it, although it is not particularly indicated
that I’m cis either.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.720
I think that we did have a certain back and
forth around posing and setting scene.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.530
I think we were given suggestions, but not
direction.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:29.430
I would say that consent was very much part
of the discourse and ethos of people’s involvement

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.320
in any particular aspect of the shoot.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.040
In organizing that event, people were cognisant
of the fact that it might be more difficult

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.689
for some women to participate in even the
photo shoot than for others.
