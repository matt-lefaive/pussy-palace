It was ridiculous. Like, it was like everybody and&nbsp;
their mom was going to go to that thing. Okay? If&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.520
you wanted to have anonymous sex, good luck with&nbsp;
that, because you know everybody who was going.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:19.520
So, it was like... It was definitely the event to&nbsp;
go to. Like, if I could describe it in a metaphor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.560
the Sugar Shack was smaller, intimate, raw...&nbsp;
But it was also amazing, to be honest with you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.080
to watch particularly a lot of Black folks&nbsp;
— but there were other folks in there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.960
too — and to see what the nuances and what it&nbsp;
took to create a space that was more like a sexy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.560
sexy space for people of colour. And&nbsp;
what the differences were around our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.880
experiences as queer people of colour, our&nbsp;
internalized stuff, our cultural stuff. Just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.720
general diversity and experiences we&nbsp;
have in relationships we have, period,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:01.000
but also with our families that are in contrast to&nbsp;
white queer spaces. You know? And I didn’t realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.398
that there was these differences necessarily&nbsp;
until I got to larger bathhouse spaces.
