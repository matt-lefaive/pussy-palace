00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760
I spent a fair amount of time in the locker&nbsp;
area, before my shift, because there were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.400
hours before I went on shift. I was talking to&nbsp;
someone; she had recently been broken up with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.640
by her girlfriend. She was awfully cute, and&nbsp;
I was just, you know, consoling her. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.580
we were sitting on the floor with our backs&nbsp;
against the lockers. It smelled like chlorine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:34.200
a little bit like sweat. And it was greenish.&nbsp;
But, overall, it was that warm red of the lobby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.326
that I would call out as my overarching colour.

00:00:39.326 --> 00:00:45.281
The steam. The wet walls. Slippery.

00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:52.170
Slippery under your touch. Something that is transient;&nbsp;
it’s only there for a minute and then it’s gone.
