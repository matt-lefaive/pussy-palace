00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.730
Bathhouses had been and have been such a huge
part of queer men’s culture.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.539
It was like, “Well, why can’t we have
that?” [laughs]

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:11.070
What, you don’t think that we want
to have casual sex?

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.160
We want to have this space and we want to
have this opportunity.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.699
And we want to be able to, like the guys do,
have that be an option for us.

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:26.560
I have always been jealous of gay men’s
community and how much space they have, sexual

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.920
space, in bathhouses and bars and parties.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.890
And it’s always frustrated me that we don’t
have that as easily accessible and available

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:36.960
to us.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.511
And I think, historically, women and trans
people have had other kinds of pressures and

00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:44.579
responsibilities than men have.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.441
In terms of the economies of life, emotional
labour, familial labour, domestic labour,

00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:49.542
and these kinds of things.

00:00:49.542 --> 00:00:50.581
So, I think there’s just a difference.

00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:56.820
I think that historically gay men’s culture
in particular reflects a very particular kind

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.149
of freedom and economic privilege.

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.229
For me, it was just powerful to be able to
do that and to take over that space and to

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.789
be shameless in being able to have that kind
of thing for ourselves.

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:14.220
In my experience at the time, the only communities
that did that, that included queer women,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.240
were the kink and leather communities.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.520
And there was a lot of spaces for that.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.610
Public play parties and dungeons.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.079
And they were mixed gender and...

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:22.549
But there hadn’t been anything...

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.000
That kind of a space for queer women, queer,
female-identified folks.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.619
I mean, it was not like we weren’t having
public sex.

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.680
You know, we were also having sex in bars
too.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.700
We were having sex in the bathroom all the
time.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.920
It also was an extension of what was already
happening.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.900
I think the intention was to make women’s
sexuality and women’s play just normal.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.867
Not such a sideshow.

00:01:45.867 --> 00:01:52.206
We want to have a place to go and get naked
and fuck and play, and it not be unusual.

00:01:52.206 --> 00:01:54.231
Our sexuality is classed, right?

00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:56.280
And our class is sexualized.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.094
I come from a family that is very outside
of normative heterosexuality.

00:02:02.094 --> 00:02:07.149
I'm from four generations of like unwed Catholic
teenage moms.

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.649
We are not respectable.

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.640
We do not [laughs] fit into the norms and
expectations of good, respectable white womanhood.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.640
And I didn't want to.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.060
My class background is a very important part
of why I was involved in the bathhouse and

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.310
my relationship with sex generally.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.490
I knew it would push my boundaries.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.940
And I just wanted to be adventurous and do
something different.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.940
I was curious.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.739
I’d heard so much about it, and I couldn’t
imagine what it would feel like to walk through

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.370
a space like that where you’re seeing other
people around you experiencing their sexuality.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.349
Like, just being by the pool and opening their
legs, and just deciding, “This is how I’m

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:46.420
going to be right now.”

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.129
Or seeing people not feeling shame for being
blatantly sexual, for wearing a “slutty”

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:59.120
outfit, these things that we’re not supposed
to do, and we’re doing them in droves, and

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.510
we’re practically high fiving each other
for it.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.249
You know, it was very freeing.

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:07.089
I remember, I think it might’ve been the
second or third time I went, and I was trying

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.693
to go to sleep.

00:03:07.693 --> 00:03:12.900
And there’s two women in the cubicle next
to me who are like talking about their childhood

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:13.900
trauma and their ex.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.510
And I’m like, “Oh my God, would you two
just shut up?

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.190
Have sex already, like enough.”

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.340
Right, so? [laughs] “Did I come here for
this?

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.340
No!”

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.120
It’s just funny because where men are just
socialized, whether they’re gay or straight,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.780
to be very assertive and when they want stuff,
they go for it, it’s a whole other weird

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.660
little dance with women because we’re not
really socialized to be that way sexually.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.939
So, it’s just about good things that people
keep telling you are bad things and realizing

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:41.939
they’re not bad things.

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:43.505
It was just like, “Go party.

00:03:43.505 --> 00:03:44.239
Go have fun.”

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.895
Sex is supposed to be good, and a good thing,
and not something to be demonized.

00:03:49.895 --> 00:03:56.530
So, for example, you could have somebody in
one room engaged in getting flogged.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.500
And then I walked into another room where
there was a group of six women sitting, playing

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.879
spin the bottle because that’s what they
felt comfortable with.

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.980
And then there was another woman who was in
her 70s, getting a lap dance.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.855
There was just everything that didn’t have
to be connected to romantic love or a formal date.

00:04:17.855 --> 00:04:20.315
It could just be sex for sex’s sake.

00:04:20.315 --> 00:04:23.580
And for yourself, for your pleasure.
