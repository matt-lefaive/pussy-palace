00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:10.490
Developing the campaign itself was a bit of
a challenge to really say out loud that queer

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.370
women have sex with men, for example.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.160
Really talk about drug use and, actually,
shared needle use as being a risk, and that

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.160
that...

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.780
Sort of, saying that out loud and talking
about our communities, or addressing those

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.590
very specific communities within any kind
of HIV prevention campaign.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.000
Even though we all kind of know that, this
was a really public campaign that was saying,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.309
“Yes, women who fuck women can also fuck
men.”

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.469
And that is where the risk is.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.879
Why wouldn’t we want to create a space?

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.520
And, you know, women come or they don’t
come.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.840
But we actually create that space that is
explicitly for sex.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.846
Right?

00:00:47.846 --> 00:00:55.710
It was kind of surprising in lots of ways
about how that actually created a dialogue

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.399
pretty broadly in the community around...

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.570
Both among gay men, particularly bathhouse
owners were...

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.220
“Are you going to just even have sex?”

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.930
And, “how messy is it going to be?

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.310
Is there going to be a lot of blood?”

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.729
[laughing] You know? That kind of stuff.

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:16.990
But also, this idea that women just aren’t
that sexual and aren’t really going to do

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.400
anything or very few were going to come.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.350
It kind of blew that all out of the water.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.189
You know, I did have my own questions.

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.640
How many women will come?

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.070
Will it be the women that we actually might
predict come that we see, you know...

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.500
Like, folks that already feel very comfortable
in their sexuality and expressing that.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.770
Or are we going to have a pretty broad range
of folks who actually want new ways of expressing

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.770
themselves?

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.130
And, in fact, that’s what it was.
