00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.840
Fundraising is a key component of every campaign.&nbsp;
There’s not a campaign I’ve ever been involved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:11.160
with, which ultimately doesn’t come down to your&nbsp;
ability to raise some funds to keep it going. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.040
this is something that they didn’t have a lot of&nbsp;
skill at. And if you’ve ever been to a community&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:22.000
event where, you know, you charge as much as&nbsp;
people want to give, you realize how little money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.280
you make and how much time goes into supposed&nbsp;
fundraiser. No, let’s have a real fundraiser.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.160
Let’s have something that would actually raise&nbsp;
real money. And so, the Oyster Bar fundraiser was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.120
literally the outcome of that. It was the ability&nbsp;
to actually connect with people who had money,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.468
who would support the cause, and you ask them for&nbsp;
real money.

00:00:42.468 --> 00:00:46.880
I’m known to be loud and demanding

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:54.360
when [laughs] the time comes to get money, to get&nbsp;
people to give. So, it came naturally that that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.360
was the role that I play, to squeeze every dollar&nbsp;
out of the room. Absolutely for a good cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.880
Because I’ve done it before in myriads of&nbsp;
fundraiser. My late husband, Jack Layton,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.132
also specialized in that, so, between us, we used&nbsp;
our mouth for a cause.

00:01:11.132 --> 00:01:12.829
To get the context of how

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:17.160
this developed, when she got elected to Metro&nbsp;
Council, and I came on board, and we formed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:24.080
a partnership that we would spend the time we&nbsp;
have available to us to try to use that office&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.040
to change the world. And so, when something like&nbsp;
the Pussy Palace raid happened, that office just,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.840
kind of, came alive. One of the things we knew&nbsp;
what to do was to raise funds, and the Pussy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.002
Palace defence team needed money to be raised.

00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:44.097
It was easy. [laughs] I’ve been to events where

00:01:44.097 --> 00:01:51.000
I would call out, and there would be silence.&nbsp;
And that was the exact opposite. [laughs] So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.280
joyous giving, or giving because of rage, giving&nbsp;
to go, “huh, here we are,” as a form of power.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.800
It doesn’t matter if it’s five bucks, 10&nbsp;
bucks, or 100 bucks. Didn’t matter. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.560
was that feeling that, “yeah, we are in&nbsp;
this together.” A sense of unity. Let’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.880
show them. [laughs] Being able to feel that&nbsp;
intensity was wonderful and unforgettable. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.269
there wasn’t a huge amount of money in the room,&nbsp;
but people dug deep.

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.193
What struck me right away

00:02:23.193 --> 00:02:30.000
was the way in which the organizers were behaving.&nbsp;
They had their boas on, they were holding up their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.720
panties. They were not acting as if they’re in&nbsp;
a Rodney’s Oyster House, you know, in front of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.640
people who have thousands of dollars, and they are&nbsp;
going to come to them, really sweet, bowing their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.960
head and saying, “Could we have some money for our&nbsp;
cause?” They weren’t there just to get money. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:54.920
were there to keep alive what the whole purpose&nbsp;
of the Pussy Palace was, which is a celebration&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:02.200
of female sexuality. And that was on display the&nbsp;
whole time. I don’t think Rodney’s Oyster House&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.548
has ever had such an event. [Gallagher and Chow&nbsp;
chuckle] I know I’ve never seen one like that.
