00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
Folks I hung out with, we were very much about&nbsp;
not standing around in our perfect outfits,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:13.020
but in getting dirty and messy. So, it would&nbsp;
have been really slutty, like, lacy stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:20.880
Black and red fish nets with, some kind of, like,&nbsp;
lacy lingerie, but very little and very practical,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.080
so... When I first came to Toronto, I presented&nbsp;
in a very androgynous way. And I came to, sort of,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.620
reclaim this femme-ness that I had rejected&nbsp;
before. You know, I’m in my early twenties, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.060
So, I’m exploring what it means to be a feminist,&nbsp;
and can you wear heels? And all these stuff that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.680
seem ridiculous to me now, but at the time were&nbsp;
important things that I was working through. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.240
I was reclaiming lingerie, reclaiming a bunch of&nbsp;
femme stuff for an audience that was women and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.700
trans people and butches. By trans, I should&nbsp;
mention, I’m using that in a really umbrella,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.809
broad way that includes, like, non-binary, gender&nbsp;
fluid, butches, bois. Like, that whole spectrum.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.220
There was a lot of judgment about being into&nbsp;
certain things and meaning that you’re, like, just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.060
replicating patriarchal ideas. And the folks I&nbsp;
was associating with were really saying, “We don’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.940
give a shit. Like, everyone deserves pleasure.&nbsp;
Everyone deserves to express themselves however&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.480
they want.” And that was my kind of feminism.&nbsp;
That’s why I loved the kink scene so much. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.660
body positivity was incredible. Like, there was&nbsp;
just so much acceptance of different ages and body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:40.620
types and presentations, and people would shift&nbsp;
their presentations in the community over time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.840
and nobody... Like, it was all just celebrated.&nbsp;
Like, it felt really comfortable. So, I would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.620
have been wearing clothes probably way more femme&nbsp;
and quote unquote sexy than I would have in my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.800
day-to-day life, because it was a space where&nbsp;
I felt excited and safe to present in that way.
