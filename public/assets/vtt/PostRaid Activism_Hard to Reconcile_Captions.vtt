00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.960
I couldn’t believe that if anybody had been&nbsp;
attending the event, that they would’ve thought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.000
anything was wrong or bad. So, I was just like,&nbsp;
“Well, if they were here and they saw everything,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.760
then they knew that we were having just a nice&nbsp;
time. Nobody was messy, and nobody was mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.240
and everybody was in a great mood.” Couldn’t they&nbsp;
have told them that? Like, how nice we all were,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.000
and what a great time we were having, and how&nbsp;
everyone was being really safe and nice and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.486
consensual with each other?

00:00:25.486 --> 00:00:28.552
Police are going to&nbsp;be a certain 
kind of witness on the stand. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.552 --> 00:00:34.760
they’re always going to tell a story from their&nbsp;
law enforcement perspective and they, of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.200
never think that they do anything wrong. So,&nbsp;
they’re just telling the story from their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.920
perspective. So, nothing about that particularly&nbsp;
surprised me. The thing is, I think judges hear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.440
this stuff all the time, right? Like, judges...&nbsp;
they are accustomed to hearing two stories&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.480
about the same event that could not be more&nbsp;
different. There’s nothing unusual about that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.360
right? It’s often hard to reconcile that you&nbsp;
are both telling a story about the same event,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.725
but your narrative could not be more different.
