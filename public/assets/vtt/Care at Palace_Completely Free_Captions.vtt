00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.600
Earlier in the night, I had an encounter with&nbsp;
someone who asked me about money. So, I don’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.520
know if that was connected or not, but it was the&nbsp;
only... [groans] One time I was casually asked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.958
if I took donations, or if money was involved, if&nbsp;
it was free, and I was like, “Oh, it’s completely&nbsp;free.&nbsp;

00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:26.240
There’s nothing... No money involved&nbsp;
in the situation.” But this person was shy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:35.480
kept a fair amount of clothing on, but not too&nbsp;
much. Like, had a bra, pair of pants and, like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.920
a watch. Things that you wouldn’t maybe normally&nbsp;
have at the temple. I wasn’t sure. You know? But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:49.880
anyway, this person asked me twice if I accepted&nbsp;
money. And they were someone who I had never seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.880 --> 00:01:00.474
They were middle-aged. They were not able to make&nbsp;
eye contact very well. That’s not abnormal.&nbsp;

00:01:00.474 --> 00:01:07.880
You know? And I was just totally.... I tried to get&nbsp;
them to engage, and they didn’t want to engage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.520
I asked them if they needed anything, or if&nbsp;
they wanted a blessing. And I can’t remember&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.280
what happened after that. They may have said that&nbsp;
they wanted a kiss, but I’m not sure. And I don’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.120
know if that actually means anything, in terms&nbsp;
of how police officers might engage undercover.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.665
But this person, I could tell, was dealing with&nbsp;
a lot of internal conflict about being there.
