00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.320
Women’s sexual prowess has always been downplayed.&nbsp;
It’s just like, “Women don’t want to fuck other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.400
women.” And that’s not true. It’s just not true.&nbsp;
But there’s very little opportunities for these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.080
things, unless you start going into communities&nbsp;
that involve cisgendered men, which you don’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.000
always want to, right? There’s not ever been&nbsp;
anything like the Pussy Palace. Nothing.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.503
Felt like a space to...

00:00:23.503 --> 00:00:28.360
be empowered differently, for lots of&nbsp;
different people. And also, to celebrate how good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.120
we could be to each other and how much pleasure we&nbsp;
could make available to ourselves and each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.000
And just... Even though, in my experience, it&nbsp;
wasn’t like... it didn’t feel necessarily any more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.480
risqué than a nightclub sometimes, it did have a&nbsp;
purpose that felt much more driven by sexuality.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.531
And that was kind of cool.

00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:49.800
I definitely saw it was&nbsp;an assertion of 
queer women’s sexuality as valid,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.080
as something that needed real space, places where&nbsp;
it could happen. I think everybody would have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.920
happy I’m sure for it to just go on without the&nbsp;
damn raid. But on the other hand, in a way that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.320
also pushed some of the visibility of women’s&nbsp;
sexuality forward in Toronto. And also, then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.920
what’s followed from that is trans identity has&nbsp;
also... It’s been able to ride that same journey,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.971
in a way.

00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:22.080
For the people that were wanting to break&nbsp;
from everyone else’s expectations of them,

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.160
it gave them a place to go do that. You could&nbsp;
go to a kink club, and you could get a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.640
bit of that. [laughing] You could go to a&nbsp;
bar and make out in the bathrooms pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.160
aggressively. Like, you could... You could do all&nbsp;
these things. But this was a space specifically,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.520
like, zoned for it, right? Which was awfully&nbsp;
empowering, and exciting, and a little naughty,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.013
and all these things that we hadn’t 
had, really,&nbsp;as a community.

00:01:47.013 --> 00:01:49.440
I actually enjoyed the lead up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.480
to the first bathhouse and the energy that&nbsp;
came with that. The bathhouse itself was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:02.600
mind blowing in terms of how many people were&nbsp;
there, that we ran out of towels, that it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.640
so hot inside that the sprinkler system went off.&nbsp;
It felt historic when I was in it. When I left,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.253
I was like, “Wow, this was really a big deal.”

00:02:12.253 --> 00:02:15.163
I found the experience of being part of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.163 --> 00:02:20.520
[Toronto Women’s] Bathhouse Committee, as well as&nbsp;
just having participated in the bathhouse through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.783
its years, to be so transformative.
And I’m so&nbsp;thankful.

00:02:25.783 --> 00:02:27.560
You know, it’s fond memories overall.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.559
I mean obviously the raid was traumatic, but&nbsp;
everything else around it, you know,

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:33.282
 was a great learning&nbsp;opportunity.

00:02:33.282 --> 00:02:38.777
From the other committee members,&nbsp;from
the patrons for how I evolved as a human.

00:02:38.777 --> 00:02:41.080
So, I’m grateful for having been a part of it.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.440
And I&nbsp;do think it’s also important
to not forget that

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.800
the crux of anti-queerness is about who people&nbsp;
desire, and how that intersects with social norms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.560
at a particular moment in time. And so, desire is&nbsp;
another possible organizing principle that needs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:06.160
to be celebrated, and again, protected. We need&nbsp;
to remind ourselves of that from time to time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:15.560
Obviously, what happened with the police was wrong&nbsp;
and wounding. That being said, it coalesced people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:24.720
into more fierceness, made people more defiant,&nbsp;
more loyal to sexual space politics. There’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.400
people who came to know each other, become friends&nbsp;
and lovers because of the raid. It made love&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.040
happen between people, and so it was defining. The&nbsp;
politics around the Palace changed so much during&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:45.160
that period of time. It was deeper conversation,&nbsp;
it was more cognizant, especially of trans people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.800
in the space. Yeah, that happened and now we have&nbsp;
new gifts, new opportunities to care for each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.800 --> 00:04:01.208
other and to speak to the most subtle things&nbsp;
that agents of the state do to control us.
