00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:08.820
I was walking out as they were&nbsp;
walking in. We passed them,

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.880
and my partner and I rubbernecked, and we&nbsp;
were like, “What the fuck is happening?”

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:36.300
I saw them come in and walk down the hall. I could&nbsp;
hear my heart beating in my ears. The head guy,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.240
his manner was slick and patronizing.&nbsp;
Think he had an elbow on the counter,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.780
and he’s like... He didn’t call me “little&nbsp;
lady,” but he just might as well have.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.500
I had no real clear idea of our legal&nbsp;
right to even do this. When they showed up,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.140
my response was, “Ah. I’ve been caught.&nbsp;
Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, I’ll open the door, sir."

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.200
I didn’t have any kind of clarity that they&nbsp;
shouldn’t be here, that this was our space.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.900
I heard it over the headset. They were saying&nbsp;
something about men coming into the space.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.459
I wasn’t clear. I wasn’t clear even at first that&nbsp;
they were police. I just knew that they were men. 

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:41.640
The voices in my ear were saying, like,&nbsp;
“Tell people quietly. Don’t make a big scene,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.880
but let people know if you can that&nbsp;
there are men in the space.”

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.042
Somebody had said that there was lap dances&nbsp;
happening downstairs, and I was like, “Lap Dances?!"

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:54.540
So, I run all the way downstairs and&nbsp;the staff
were there. I said, “Hey, where are the

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.460
lap dances happening?” And then I see these dudes&nbsp;
standing behind them. I said, “Who are those guys?

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.740
Are they here to repair the pool?” And they went,&nbsp;
“They’re not pool repairmen. They’re cops."

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.300
I went straight up to them and said, “What can&nbsp;
I help you with?” And the guy at the front,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.900
he and another one of the cops stopped,&nbsp;
and then two of the others peeled off

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.440
and started heading through the club. And&nbsp;
I said, “Where are those guys going?”

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.720
So, I was on the first floor when they came&nbsp;
in. The energy changed. Things went shushed

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.220
very quickly. Everyone’s like, “What’s going on?&nbsp;
What’s going on?” And then I heard people say,

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.140
“The cops are here. What do we do?” We just stood&nbsp;
there and waited to see what would happen. 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.180
And all of a sudden you see one woman come&nbsp;
into the corner of the pool and lean down,

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.940
and it was like a wildfire. Everybody in the&nbsp;
pool scattered. They just jumped out of it,

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.780
grabbed towels. There was a mass&nbsp;
exodus of people leaving.

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:10.585
Rushing up the stairs came Richard

00:03:10.585 --> 00:03:13.042
and was&nbsp;like, “Shut the bar down. Close it up.

00:03:13.042 --> 00:03:16.709
You, you, okay. Two more bottles. Ch-ch-ch. Bye.”

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.709
By the time any police officers arrived on,

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.200
I guess it would’ve been the&nbsp;
second level of the club,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.040
that bar was shut and the cupboard&nbsp;
behind me was locked with a padlock.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.420
So, we walked up the one flight of stairs. I took&nbsp;
the permit off the wall. I said, “Look, as you

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.080
can see, it’s all in order. We have a permit for&nbsp;
the event. Is there any problem?” He said, “No,

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.500
there doesn’t appear to be a problem. We’re going&nbsp;
to need to walk around the space.” And I said,

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.520
“I don’t think that’s a good idea. Like, I&nbsp;
can’t stop you, but this is...all women event.”

00:03:49.542 --> 00:03:51.500
I was in the change room. Still have on

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.180
my leather pants, and nothing else. And I’m&nbsp;
not a light person. Maybe masculine-identified,

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.780
but I’m also very heavily chested. So,&nbsp;
it was kind of like, the girls are out,

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.940
the girls are busy tonight. I was with somebody&nbsp;
else. Police officer walks up to us and the cop, I

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.540
have no pity for him because he doesn’t know where&nbsp;
to look. And I’m like, “Can I help you?” 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.960
They were clearly lookin’ at tits. It was the way&nbsp;
they looked, the way they acted. They were not

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:22.140
polite. They were there for one thing: to watch&nbsp;
the women, ogle the women, stare at the women.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.880
I went into a panic. I thought, “Well, I’m wearing&nbsp;
black. If I just go into a corner, no one will see

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.300
me.” And the one thing that sticks with me is that&nbsp;
one of them was whistling. “Do-do-do-do-do.” And

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.920
I thought, “Well, that’s odd. Strange thing to&nbsp;
be doing when you’re supposedly raiding.” 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.560
Oh, my God, yes. Laughing and pointing.&nbsp;
It didn’t feel like a raid. What it felt

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.200
like were a couple of tourists at a&nbsp;
zoo. As a trans person from the 90s,

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.180
I was terrified of the police, especially as&nbsp;
a trans woman. There were so many stories I’d

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.000
heard from trans women, especially street&nbsp;
workers, where cops had arrested them and

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.420
then put them into a male jail cell. So, I&nbsp;
was personally terrified. I wasn’t afraid

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.580
of whether I had done something. I was&nbsp;
just afraid that they were there.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:20.940
I remember feeling confused. “Is this a big&nbsp;
deal? Are we all going to die? Or is this

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.920
one of those things where... Given a hassle&nbsp;
and then it finishes, and nobody even thinks

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.060
twice about it?” The other thing I remember&nbsp;
is just thinking, “Wow, men are really tall.”

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.300
Because once they entered the space, it became&nbsp;
so clear that the rest of us were so small. 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:42.360
This particular bathhouse had the most&nbsp;
BIPOC folks in any bathhouse that we’d had,

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.160
and certainly black women left really quickly,&nbsp;
trans folks left really quickly. If you’ve ever

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.600
had to deal with the cops, you know, they’re&nbsp;
dangerous. And folks really felt scared. 

00:06:04.375 --> 00:06:06.042
When I open the door, three,

00:06:06.042 --> 00:06:11.280
maybe four of them were blocking the door. They&nbsp;
held us in there for... Mmm, I feel like it

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.680
was at least 20 minutes. They asked our names,&nbsp;
they were writing notes, they asked for ID.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.400
And I remember one of the bathhouse committee

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.240
members was standing outside the room,&nbsp;
and she made eye contact with me,

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.780
communicating that they were watching. Our&nbsp;
people were taking care of each other.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.580
They asked me what the sling was. And&nbsp;
I said, “It’s a sex sling. You’ve never

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:38.040
seen one before?” Like I said, I was filled&nbsp;
with bravado that night. I was intoxicated,

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.900
so I had confidence juice in me. I was up&nbsp;
for the little challenge of it. And I was

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.220
a little bit like, “How dare you? You look&nbsp;
like idiots. These are just a bunch of women

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.360
having a good time naked. This is what you&nbsp;
want to spend your resources on, really?”

00:06:59.042 --> 00:07:04.620
As one of the people who was a signatory on the&nbsp;
SOP [special occasion permit], I knew that it

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:10.840
was going to be me. The cops made it clear&nbsp;
that they were going to try and nail us.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:27.660
Well, the actions taken by the police were&nbsp;
complete bullshit. It was an abuse of state power.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:33.300
The police will kick around whoever they can get&nbsp;
away with kicking around. And then, as a result of

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:38.100
the raid, they found out that they couldn’t. They&nbsp;
had no public support for the raid, and so that’s

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:45.120
actually why we won. We won because the community&nbsp;
solidly and immediately backed us. Because you

00:07:45.083 --> 00:07:47.460
have to have that kind of power if you’re&nbsp;
going to fight something like the police.

00:07:58.417 --> 00:08:08.520
Obviously, what happened with the police was wrong&nbsp;
and wounding. That being said, it coalesced people

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:18.180
into more fierceness, made people more defiant,&nbsp;
made them more loyal to sexual space politics.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:24.120
There’s people who came to know each other, become&nbsp;
friends and lovers because of the raid. It made

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.940
love happen between people, and so it was&nbsp;
defining. The politics around the Palace changed

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:38.580
so much during that period of time. It was deeper&nbsp;
conversation, it was more cognizant, especially of

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:45.300
trans people in the space. Yeah, that happened and&nbsp;
now we have new gifts, new opportunities to care

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:54.180
for each other and to speak to the most subtle&nbsp;
things that agents of the state do to control us.
