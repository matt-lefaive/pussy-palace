00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:07.880
The whole rest of the night was more heavy. Shock.&nbsp;
And some reclaiming, too. Reclaiming of space and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.880
body. And, like, stamping and stomping out that&nbsp;
anger. Brushing it off and, like, being defiant,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.480
and being like, “This is what it means to be in&nbsp;
this space. This is what it means to be part of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.880
a legacy of marginalization and criminalization.”&nbsp;
And also counting our blessings that the space&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.000
even happened and that people... That it wasn’t worse.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.680
That being said, the energy of the invasion was

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.760
felt for years. People came to me and needed to&nbsp;
talk about that for years. I think people had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:51.920
more trouble transitioning into the space without&nbsp;
reassurance or without a plan of protection in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:59.200
case they came again. If you were in the space,&nbsp;
and you were dealing with police or imprisonment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:07.320
aggression, abuse, safety, stalking, ridicule,&nbsp;
ridicule, ridicule was often something that people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.000
needed to figure out how to counter.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.870
“He saw me in&nbsp;this position.”

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.726
“He laughed at me.”

00:01:17.726 --> 00:01:21.657
“I never could&nbsp;wear that again."

00:01:21.657 --> 00:01:28.045
“I went home and broke something&nbsp;that 
I just can't... I can never repair.”

00:01:28.045 --> 00:01:33.000
My work, I felt, was to try to bring it 
around to being present,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.141
to the fact that this Palace could continue.

00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:43.200
And what can it mean now within that context? So,&nbsp;
when someone comes and they’re up high in their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.760
chest breathing, trying to figure out how to touch&nbsp;
their feet or imagine the feeling of their feet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.760 --> 00:02:00.960
touching the floor, acknowledging that their feet&nbsp;
were on a floor of a house that was decades old,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.000
that that house had walls that supported the floor&nbsp;
that supported their feet. And that the place had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.160
a foundation. And to picture that foundation.&nbsp;
To understand that that foundation came after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:22.040
years of beauty and conflict underneath it.&nbsp;
The centuries. Thinking back to when it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:30.280
York. Thinking back prior to colonization. Like,&nbsp;
just to say, like, there is a safer space, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:38.560
there’s no safe space. And the Palace sometimes...&nbsp;
I don’t know if it’s part of how we talked... How&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:50.080
politics happen, but there’s that [groans] sort of&nbsp;
essentialist thinking that “Well, if there’s women&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.920
or women and trans people in this space, it’s&nbsp;
different.” That pride mingling with delusion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.400
[laughs] to some degree, of safety. And being able&nbsp;
to be, like, “Hard things are going to happen;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.720
they have happened here.” So, trying to figure&nbsp;
out either through visualization, mindfulness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:17.400
and then through finding the spot of joy that they&nbsp;
could carry into this new space, acknowledging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.080
it is a space. You know? But that they planted a&nbsp;
seed there first, before that happened. And here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.920
they are again. And that the police didn’t&nbsp;
take that away. To let go of that because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:37.560
it wasn’t spoiled. Take apart those metaphors&nbsp;
so that you can recover a sense of agency so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.284
that you’re not carrying anxiety unnecessarily.&nbsp;
Right? Especially when the point is pleasure.
