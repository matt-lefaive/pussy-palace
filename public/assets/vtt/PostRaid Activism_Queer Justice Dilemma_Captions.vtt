00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.200
The legal argument totally essentialized&nbsp;
gender in really old-fashioned kinds of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.080
ways that I think were contrary to the spirit&nbsp;
of the project. Like, it’s different if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.200
have a bunch of middle-class ladies who are&nbsp;
at the Y[MCA] or something, in the shower,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.280
and then a man comes in. Okay. Well, they’re&nbsp;
going to feel threatened by that. But the Pussy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.092
Palace didn’t try and draw rigid gender lines.

00:00:24.092 --> 00:00:28.160
The&nbsp;presence of trans bodies was not really, you know,&nbsp;

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.640
part of the discussion. It really became a, kind&nbsp;
of, women’s privacy. Women were at this place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.480
They had a reasonable expectation of privacy. Five&nbsp;
male police officers shouldn’t be able to barge in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.040
and see them in various states of undress. That&nbsp;
was really the focus. And the thing is, it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.411
successful. It worked.

00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:52.360
There was potential for a&nbsp;more radical 
argument to be made in public. Plus,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.240
I was a professor of Criminology, but I was&nbsp;
also the only person in Canada who had ever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.320
done empirical research on liquor licensing. So,&nbsp;
I knew a lot about liquor licensing law. I knew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.600
that the police generally don’t enforce. And if&nbsp;
they do it, they do it usually for other reasons&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.440
because the licensing laws give them an excuse to&nbsp;
go in somewhere without a warrant. Often wish that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.960
I’d been able to get that kind of expertise a bit&nbsp;
more in front of the judge because then, the women&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.920
from the Pussy Palace wouldn’t have had to feel&nbsp;
awkward being pushed into this gender essentialist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.480
argument about, “Oh, women shouldn’t be subject&nbsp;
to the male gaze of male police officers,” which I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.640
always thought was, like... You know, a completely&nbsp;
bullshit argument for them specifically to make.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.520
This is where I, you know, I toggle between being&nbsp;
a critical scholar and a practical lawyer. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.320
question is, did you want the two people who were&nbsp;
charged to get acquitted? Or did you want this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.960
to be a broader political, something? And so, if&nbsp;
you want it to be a broader political something,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.560
then you might do a different strategy. If&nbsp;
you want them to be acquitted, then this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.280
what works. And so, they went with, you know, a&nbsp;
strategy that works. And this is the problem with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.880
law more generally. You know, you make strategic&nbsp;
choices in law about what is more likely to result&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.200
in an acquittal versus the kind of arguments that&nbsp;
you might want to make as a social and political&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.498
movement. And those two things are often not&nbsp;
completely unconnected.

00:02:22.498 --> 00:02:24.201
The thing about queer is...

00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:30.040
Doesn’t lend itself very well to&nbsp;winning 
in court. So, it’s probably true that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:37.520
Frank Addario chose the most winning strategy.&nbsp;
Okay, fine, but what are the subsequent effects?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.440
He could’ve done a much better job if he had&nbsp;
sat and listened and appreciated the difference&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.960
between queer identities and traditional women’s&nbsp;
identities. You know? [laughs] And then he could’ve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.960 --> 00:03:00.720
defined the harm of the police raid not as men&nbsp;
ogling women, but as a police abuse of power,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.760
regardless of the gender of anyone there or their,&nbsp;
you know, sexual preferences or anything of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:16.560
sort. The system could accommodate outrage about&nbsp;
men ogling women who were almost naked. That fits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.719
into the system. But the queer project, 
that you&nbsp;couldn’t really do.

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:24.240
 The choices you make in terms

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.800
of your litigation strategy can, you know, really&nbsp;
have an impact in the long term on, sort of, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.120
broader movement. Having said that, I’m not sure&nbsp;
it really happened here because the charges were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.520
ultimately dismissed, and they were ultimately&nbsp;
successful going in front of the Human Rights&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.000
Commission and actually getting damages. And I&nbsp;
think that, that was actually a really great... A&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.120
great moment. Slapping the police on the knuckles&nbsp;
to say, you know, not only was it, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.766
not a good search and seizure, but actually, you&nbsp;
violated these people’s human rights.

00:03:54.766 --> 00:04:03.640
But it was a disappointing way of winning. And one thing I’ve&nbsp;
learned studying feminist litigation, how you win&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.280
a case is important, not whether you win it or&nbsp;
not, for future purposes. You can win a case,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.920
and then the lawyer goes home happy because he won&nbsp;
his case and he can tell his buddies, “Oh, I won&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.600
in court today,” but down the road, that argument&nbsp;
or that judge’s decision may be bad for other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.320
people and other things that you also want to&nbsp;
promote, and of course the lawyer isn’t going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.491
be there at that point. 

00:04:26.491 --> 00:04:32.440
It was a very calculated&nbsp;strategy that just 
focused on, “how do we best get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.160
these folks acquitted?” That wouldn’t have been&nbsp;
the strategy if it was about, “Let’s show how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.120
queer this space was.” It’s this problematic thing&nbsp;
that, you know, sometimes the winning argument&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.883
isn’t always going to be the best argument.

00:04:43.883 --> 00:04:46.080
The women of the Pussy Palace were trying to do

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.880
something that was before its time in a way, ahead&nbsp;
of its time. They were very brave, and it’s no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:59.266
wonder that it would’ve been really difficult to&nbsp;
find a hook in the legal apparatus for their view.
