A real split in that friend group was about, “No,&nbsp;
that’s a very Downtown town thing. We don’t want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.810
to do that. We like to do Uptown things.” And&nbsp;
Uptown meaning Richmond Hill and that kind of area.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:22.800
And so, I understand that it’s complicated&nbsp;
to want more people of colour, to not really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.160
have access or connection to a lot of people of&nbsp;
colour. And when I even have connection to people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.000
of colour, they actually don’t feel connected to&nbsp;
the event. We try all these different things.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.640
And it was efforts to right this imbalance. After a&nbsp;
few bathhouses of it not really materializing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:50.000
additional people coming who were of colour,&nbsp;
I just... I was musing with folks. I’m like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.300
“I don’t think my people want to come. Not in&nbsp;
this year, not in this time, not in this place.”
