00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.730
Encountering this postcard reminded me that
there was a kind of collaboration around making

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.500
the bathhouse space more inclusive that was
not a one directional movement out from the

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.920
bathhouse committee.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.890
And being involved in that photo shoot was
a sexy and fun thing that in some ways changed

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.050
my comfort level attending the bathhouse,
subsequently.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.830
Doing the photo shoot involved creating a
kind of affective space, and a space that

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.740
was sensual and erotic.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.280
Having that experience then, created possibility
or the imagining of possibility for how I

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.510
might enjoy the bathhouse differently than
I had previously experienced it.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.961
And I think was intended to impact people’s
imagination of the bathhouse in ways that

00:00:46.961 --> 00:00:49.929
opened up possibility without being didactic

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:53.365
or addressing people at the level of, 
“These are the rules of inclusion."

00:00:53.365 --> 00:00:56.039
Rather, “Here’s a tableau of what is possible.”

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.649
So, I wanted to flag that there were sort
of spaces around the bathhouse which contributed

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.259
to shifting the culture of the bathhouse,
and that I appreciate the labour of making them.

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.290
It was not simply a question of some words
on a flyer.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.490
That producing visuals changes how people
perceive the space in a more visceral way,

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.180
and it takes more work.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.110
And it involves outreach and connection.
