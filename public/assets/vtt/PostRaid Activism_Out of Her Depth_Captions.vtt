00:00:00.154 --> 00:00:05.080
The crown attorney, the prosecutor that they sent&nbsp;
in, I remember her being described as being very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.360
green. She seemed really out of her depth.&nbsp;
And the prosecutor’s understanding of trans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.200
identities was not sophisticated, would be an&nbsp;
understatement. She was essentially trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.280
prove, or at least arguing the idea that no one&nbsp;
should have been upset that men were there when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:30.360
the male officers showed up because isn’t a trans&nbsp;
man a man or isn’t a... Oh, no, sorry, a trans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.916
woman. They were trying to argue that like...&nbsp;
I can barely even deal with the logic.

00:00:34.916 --> 00:00:35.600
How they

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.960
correlated cisgendered men and trans men, they&nbsp;
just put them on the same fucking level. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.840
the crown attorney just did not get it. I feel&nbsp;
like the prosecution was not prepared for this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.250
did not have enough research.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.558
And Janet [Rowe]&nbsp;put them in their place

00:00:53.558 --> 00:00:55.785
 so beautifully. That it just...

00:00:55.785 --> 00:00:59.149
It was almost laughable. You know, the&nbsp;
cops’ case fell apart.

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:00.935
You have educated women

00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:06.240
laying it out for them, and they’re just missing&nbsp;
it. It’s like those people who argue for, like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.840
the trans bathroom stuff. Doesn’t make&nbsp;
any sense whatsoever. They just don’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.877
understand our community, and I don’t know if&nbsp;
it could be even taught. So, liars and stupid.
