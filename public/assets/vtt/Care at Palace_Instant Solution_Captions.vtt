00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.650
In 2000, Polaroids made a huge comeback because
no one had phones.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.029
And so, they reissued the Polaroid.

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:08.800
And, like, they became, like, the queer...

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.150
Everyone had them on their fridges.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.290
And so, it was like, “Oh, this is a perfect
solution to the problem of...

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.500
How could I do this?

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.289
Would I take people’s names and then develop
the film and get them photographs?”

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.289
And that didn’t make sense.

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.950
And so, then it was like, this Polaroid idea
came up.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.599
And to me, it was just perfect because, yeah,
it was instantaneous.

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.420
It eliminated issues around consent because
they would walk out the door with it.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.420
I mean, sometimes I wouldn’t even see the
photo.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.280
Like, sometimes they’d walk away before
it developed.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.162
I mean, often they’d stay because they’d
be excited to look at it with me, and we’d

00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:41.230
look at it and then they’d, you know, they’d
leave.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.430
But it was just perfect.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.850
And the aesthetic was awesome.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:44.910
Like, Polaroids are just sexy.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.800
You can’t take anything with a Polaroid
and it doesn’t look sexy.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.660
So, I think the aesthetic was really cool
and interesting.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.219
The immediacy of it was really wonderful.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.859
And it meant that the, like, the experience
completed itself right in that moment and

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.860
could be shared, both with me, but with others
and...

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.040
Like, people would not have been willing to
do it, if they couldn’t walk away with that image.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.040
Like, they knew that I wasn’t, you know,
that I wouldn’t be keeping anything of them.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.480
So, I think that was very important.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.510
I wish, I mean, now I’m like, “Oh my God,
I wish we had all those pictures.”

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.990
Because it would be such a great collection
of photos.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.390
But, you know, that’s the nature of it.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.390
It’s, like, ephemeral.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.890
It disappears.
