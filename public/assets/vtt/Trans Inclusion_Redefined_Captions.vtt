I also was invested in the utopianism of,&nbsp;
like, a free, erotic space for women and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:15.560
gender-non-conforming people. I suppose I hoped&nbsp;
that the bathhouse would be a place where, for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:24.520
want of a less tritely academic phrase, a certain&nbsp;
essentialism of identity as the limit on what was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:31.040
conceivable or desirable within lesbian or queer&nbsp;
women’s space would be loosened if not completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:40.360
untethered. Many trans women are heterosexual or&nbsp;
bisexual. Many trans women work in sex work and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:49.120
date in the context of their work. So, one of the&nbsp;
limits of the bathhouse — which as a queer woman I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.400
was very comfortable with in some ways — was not&nbsp;
having men included, unless they were trans men,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.280
which produced a certain kind of contradiction&nbsp;
at the level of whether trans men’s manhood was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.040
granted or not. Trans women who want to get&nbsp;
some action, who are into cis men, have no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:14.040
reason to go to the women’s bathhouse and thus&nbsp;
are not included. So, having an expansive idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.520
of it being a space for queer women’s sexuality&nbsp;
and that including transsexual women would’ve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.600
involved including heterosexual transsexual women&nbsp;
and transsexual women who might be working. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.720
in some level, there’s a contradiction there&nbsp;
between the idea of a women-only space or a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:40.240
women-and-trans-only space and making room for&nbsp;
the desires of queer women who are marginalized&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.920
on the basis of their queerness, which is to say&nbsp;
heterosexual trans women. I did often experience&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.480
the bathhouse as an antagonistic place, but it was&nbsp;
heterogeneous. I had good and loving and friendly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.640
relations with many people who were involved in&nbsp;
organizing it and who attended it. So, I don’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.200
want that to disappear within a depiction of the&nbsp;
kind of alienation I sometimes felt there, or the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.087
critique I have of some of the overarching ethos&nbsp;
of how trans women’s inclusion was conceptualized.
