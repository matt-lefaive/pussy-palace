There’s such a history of gay male sexuality&nbsp;
in public spaces and the history of gay male&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.760
bathhouse raids, what that did in terms&nbsp;
of motivating the community. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:21.000
I’ve always felt like we don’t take lesbian&nbsp;
sexuality as seriously because it’s women,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.160
and it’s somehow not as threatening, or something,&nbsp;
and... Not that I ever would want it to be raided,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:34.720
but it was important in a way that it was, like,&nbsp;
women demanding the space and this opportunity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.200
in our society as well, and culturally to create&nbsp;
their own space to express their own sexuality,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:48.280
and that it exists, right, in a more public&nbsp;
way. Like, gay male activism is always tied&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.640
to sex. Lesbian activism isn’t always tied to&nbsp;
sex, and I think it’s important that sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.476
it is because sex is a huge part of how&nbsp;
we express our gender and our sexuality.
