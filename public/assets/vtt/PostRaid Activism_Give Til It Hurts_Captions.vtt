00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.000
The purpose of the meeting was to generate&nbsp;
community support for the resistance to the raid,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.360
which it was very successful at doing. So,&nbsp;
a number of us spoke. I was on the panel as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.075
one of the speakers, but I was terrified. It was&nbsp;
my first ever public speaking.

00:00:13.075 --> 00:00:14.852
I went to The 519

00:00:14.852 --> 00:00:21.040
thinking that I was going to see the participants&nbsp;
of Pussy Palace, and what I saw was, like, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.280
entire fucking queer community, is what it felt&nbsp;
like. Literally, like, standing room only, like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.520
squished in. This was when I became a lifelong&nbsp;
fan of Olivia Chow. She said, “Okay, I want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.960
you to close your eyes. And I want you to imagine&nbsp;
that your name is the name. That you did all this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.160
work to make this event happen, and you took out&nbsp;
the liquor license. It’s your name that’s signed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.280
on the form. And now I want you to take out your&nbsp;
wallets, and I want you to give as much as you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.880
for the defence fund.” Like, I’m paraphrasing,&nbsp;
but the way she spoke was so inspiring. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.560
raised thousands of dollars in a matter of 10&nbsp;
minutes. She was like, “I’m going to start at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:08.080
$2,000. Who will give me $2,000?” And hands went&nbsp;
up around the room. I was aghast because, to me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.000
$2,000 was like... [chuckles] Awful lot of money&nbsp;
back then. And people were just handing it over.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.040
And she went down and down and down. I think&nbsp;
she was down at, like, $200, and she was going,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.000
“Come on, guys. Just skip dinners out this month.”&nbsp;
And people were... I could hear people muttering,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.080
“How much money do you spend on dinner?” [laughs]&nbsp;
But I used that, and when they came around to me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.080
I gave $50. And I couldn’t really afford&nbsp;
it, but what are you going to do? All right,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.080
give til it hurts. Because there are people&nbsp;
who are scared right now, and they need us.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.880
We raised so much money that night, just by one&nbsp;
person who was, you know, a politician, but also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.520
really committed to the community, and knew how&nbsp;
to do that. Knew how to ask people for money,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.760
and not just $5, $10, $25, but, we’re going to&nbsp;
need some significant cash. So, she did that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.473
And then, the momentum around that was that then&nbsp;
there were other actions.

00:01:59.473 --> 00:02:01.293
Hundreds of people came to the meeting,

00:02:01.293 --> 00:02:07.520
and they were extremely outraged.&nbsp;
They decided we were going to have an angry march&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.880
down Church Street, screaming “Out of the bars,&nbsp;
into the streets.” Might’ve been “Out of the bars,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.463
into the streets,” like, “queers bash back,” or&nbsp;
something like that.

00:02:15.463 --> 00:02:17.800
We emptied out of the space

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.025
and went down Church Street and then marched&nbsp;
to 52 Division headquarters.

00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:23.462
Found some masking

00:02:23.462 --> 00:02:30.120
tape and put it around people’s arms to serve&nbsp;
as march marshals. Phoned the media to let the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.650
media know that it was happening. By the time&nbsp;
we got there, there was media there.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:41.360
During the time when I was a Metro councillor, I dealt &nbsp;
with the police budget for 10 years and, at one time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.320
even served on the Police Service Board. So, on&nbsp;
policing matter, I have a great deal of interest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:55.000
because they have enormous amount of power, and,&nbsp;
occasionally, they misuse it. I remember getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.160
phone calls and, I remember, I think they were&nbsp;
in front of 52 division. And I wanted to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.520
sure that the media know that they were there.&nbsp;
So, I was phoning every media outlet. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:15.300
before emails [laughing] and text messaging. It&nbsp;
was old-fashioned phone call [laughs].&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.320
There's also a photograph of Ange [Beever] and I sitting&nbsp;
on top of the moose that was outside the police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.880
plaza at the time. I think it was one of Mel&nbsp;
Lastman’s civic engagement things to have all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.560
these big fiberglass moose sculptures throughout&nbsp;
the city, and there was a cop moose. And I don’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.680
know exactly how it happened, but someone boosted&nbsp;
Ange [Beever] and I up, so we were kissing on top&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.500
of the moose wearing our bike jackets. Super cool.&nbsp;
And that wound up in the Toronto Sun of all places too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.040
I was not at The 519. But we were at the,&nbsp;
what was called the “Panty Raid” at 52 Division.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.200
And that I remember so clearly. It was strong,&nbsp;
it was big, it was hilarious, honestly. There&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.400
were hundreds there. It was a big crowd, and&nbsp;
we were close together. Not tightly squished,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.480
but it was just the feeling of being close with&nbsp;
a whole bunch of people and being in a common&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.440
purpose. We didn’t know if they’d try to push&nbsp;
us back. They were completely stand down. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.640
even though there was anger, that wasn’t...&nbsp;
It was kind of, like, “You took us on; here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:25.080
we are.” Incredibly celebratory. People were using&nbsp;
that moment to assert the irony of the situation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.000
and, you know, really shaming the police into&nbsp;
trying to have some reasonable explanation for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.160
what they had done. But I just remember that as&nbsp;
being something that, kind of, pulled back some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:44.120
power for us in that moment. Very public, almost&nbsp;
mainstream acknowledgement of women’s sexuality,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.332
really, kind of, queer and otherwise. It felt&nbsp;
like a very strong public moment for that.
