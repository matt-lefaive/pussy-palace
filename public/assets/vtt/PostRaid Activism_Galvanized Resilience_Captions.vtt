00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.640
There was a lot of anger, and then, like, also,&nbsp;
you know, it was followed by a sense of righteous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.200
anger around like, “Fuck you guys.” Like, “You’re&nbsp;
doing this [interviewer chuckles] to get us to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.840
stop running this thing, and you’ve just screwed&nbsp;
with our entire community, right, in a way that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.040
you can’t even begin to anticipate. And, wow, did&nbsp;
you just mess with the wrong community.” Like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.200
it quickly galvanized; I have to say. Because,&nbsp;
like, in the midst of this, there were all these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.960
community events happening where everybody, like,&nbsp;
went from feeling demoralized and dismayed and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.560
traumatized to a whole bunch of us going, like,&nbsp;
“You know what? No.” You know, there’s a big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.760
event at, like, The 519 where Olivia Chow came and&nbsp;
raised, like, $10,000 in five minutes. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.240
and Tim McCaskell and all these people, like, show&nbsp;
up who had been through this before. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.320
a lot of the guys who had been part of the&nbsp;
raids. Other bathhouse owners. You know, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.800
Olivia [Chow]’s office... Like, her and her staff&nbsp;
were just incredible. Like, from the next day on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.320
they had us in their offices, like, helping us&nbsp;
navigate these systems. That level of support&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.280
from official channels, I think, meant everything&nbsp;
to all of us. You know, we weren’t on our own,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.800
and we weren’t isolated, and we weren’t having to&nbsp;
face this, like, without institutional support,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.318
in this, kind of, weird way. That was&nbsp;
unanticipated, let me just say that [laughs].
