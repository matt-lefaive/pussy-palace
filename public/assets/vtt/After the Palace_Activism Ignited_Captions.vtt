00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.760
Talking about riding in Pride, talking about&nbsp;
being at the Pussy Palace when it was raided…&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:13.400
Those are the two things that give me credibility&nbsp;
to speak on things like abolishing the police,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.280
and why we need to do that, and why we need to&nbsp;
support Black people. All BIPOC people. Why we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.520
need to stand behind Black Lives Matter&nbsp;
and Not Another Black Life. Why we need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.160
the police out of Pride. Why we need them off&nbsp;
the necks and the backs of frigging Black men,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.800
in particular, all over. And why we need&nbsp;
to actually look at and study slavery,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.639
particularly in the U.S. Because if you don’t know&nbsp;
that history, then you don’t understand how it’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:45.402
spilling over today.

00:00:45.402 --> 00:00:51.520
Everything was impacted by&nbsp;disagreements 
around race and racism in our work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.720
Who should represent the bathhouse? Who should&nbsp;
represent the impact of the charges? The media&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:04.040
really wanted to lift up and focus on the white&nbsp;
organizers. I remember that being one problem. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.920
was certainly what motivated me to want to&nbsp;
do deeper learning around race and racism,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.360
because I had seen the way that race had really&nbsp;
fractured our work. Those of us who were trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.247
to work on the same side, against the police,&nbsp;
were often in conflict with each other around&nbsp;race.&nbsp;

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:25.446
And it really undermined our work. You know,&nbsp;and
specifically, white racism was undermining the&nbsp;work.

00:01:25.446 --> 00:01:28.760
There were lots of problems with that&nbsp;
time. I’m sure that there was lots of ways&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:35.920
that that space was exclusionary and privileged.&nbsp;
But the activism that happened afterward was so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.240
special to me personally and to my friends.&nbsp;
And that was the rise also of trans rights,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:48.040
resurgence of butch-femme, and then also sex&nbsp;
workers rights and inclusion in our work, right,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.960
as activists. That all kind of happened around the&nbsp;
same time, and I think about it like Revenue Rez,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.360
there was like the occupation in Indigenous&nbsp;
movements, the G20. Like, it’s always kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.720
of an eye roll when people get nostalgic. But&nbsp;
I guess, it’s just a little bit nostalgic for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.190
me because it was such a special time in my own&nbsp;
awakening and engagements in queer community.
