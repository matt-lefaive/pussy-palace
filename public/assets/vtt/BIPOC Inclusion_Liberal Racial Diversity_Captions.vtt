Part of our problem was, like, a liberal racial&nbsp;
diversity analysis that was tokenistic and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:11.280
focused on representation, not on meaningful&nbsp;
leadership by people of colour. I don’t think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.120
we understood deeply enough, like, how much&nbsp;
the raid was tied to white supremacy. That&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:25.000
even if white people are targeted as part&nbsp;
of a raid on a multi-racial space, that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.400
that’s still the operation of white supremacy.&nbsp;
And, definitely, I didn’t know that. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.360
I think I was often really confused. I think I was&nbsp;
very politically inexperienced. It was the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.080
time I had ever... It was my first organizing.&nbsp;
It was my first organizing and therefore my first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:47.920
time in a multi-racial, feminist collective. And&nbsp;
I think, looking back, like, I already felt very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.040
explicitly anti-racist. It wasn’t new to me,&nbsp;
but, looking back, there were so many ways that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.204
I just absolutely was not seeing the way that&nbsp;
white supremacy was showing up in our work.
