00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.760
Every group was different, but I would say&nbsp;
approximately one-third of the participants, I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.160
felt like there was a change. There was a genuine&nbsp;
effort. And I found when I was doing the recruits,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.040
actually, they were the easiest group because they&nbsp;
were soaking in the learning. They were also much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:24.080
more aware of the queer and trans communities. I&nbsp;
remember this one older gentleman, he said, “You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.640
know, I retire in two months. There’s no way I’m&nbsp;
going to understand all of this. [laughing] And,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.280
you know what? I don’t want to understand.”&nbsp;
[laughs] So, you kind of had those two extremes:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.560
I’m here to learn. And then you had other&nbsp;
people who just felt like it was way too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.200
complicated for them to understand, especially&nbsp;
around gender. They couldn’t understand gender&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.080
being on a spectrum. Even sexuality, they kind of&nbsp;
understood, but I had comments like, “Maybe there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.080 --> 00:01:00.080
should be a separate shower for LGBTQ people.” And&nbsp;
of course, that’s shocking and horrible. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.600
it’s horrible in the sense that they were doing&nbsp;
it out of homophobia. I was really pleased that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.320
they felt safe enough to say that to me. I&nbsp;
wanted to set up a safe environment where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.720
they could express their opinions and that we&nbsp;
could have a conversation. As a facilitator,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.040
our jobs are to walk in and work with the&nbsp;
knowledge that’s in the room and kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.960
direct the knowledge towards a place of respect&nbsp;
for each other. That’s a much longer process than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.840
two and a half hours, but the idea is to start&nbsp;
the conversations. And I do believe that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.440
police have grown. Most workshops that you do, the&nbsp;
participants are usually signing up themselves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.560
so they’re already in tune with the subject&nbsp;
matter. This one was different in that it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.360
people of all backgrounds who may or may not&nbsp;
be familiar with what you’re talking about,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.760
and the vast majority were not. So, to be&nbsp;
challenged as a facilitator on that, yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.435
I thought it was great. When you discovered a new&nbsp;
skill within yourself, it was very empowering.
