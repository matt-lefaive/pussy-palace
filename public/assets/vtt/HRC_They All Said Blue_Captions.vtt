00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.720
We’d walk in and sometimes we’d do some kind&nbsp;
of introduction exercise because people were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.980
coming from different precincts, so they didn’t&nbsp;
necessarily all know each other. We tried some ice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:17.080
breaker games. Oh boy did they not work. [laughs]&nbsp;
I remember clearly asking people to identify their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.080
favourite colour as part of their introduction,&nbsp;
and, you know, you think something really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.320
safe. [laughing] Right? A really safe question.&nbsp;
[laughing] Nobody’s going to react badly to that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:36.280
but the idea was around diversity, right? [laughs]&nbsp;
And everybody in the room, regardless of age,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:43.720
or gender, or whatever, [laughing] they identified&nbsp;
blue as their favourite colour. [laughs] To me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.880
what that identified was this broader issue&nbsp;
of a pack mentality. It’s going to be hard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.520
for anyone to dissent from the pack when we get&nbsp;
into harder issues because if they can’t say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.200
“My favourite colour is red” or “orange,” how&nbsp;
are they going to say, you know, “I disagree with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.248
you,” or “I think we should be more in tune with&nbsp;
the queer and trans communities.” &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.248 --> 00:01:12.680
You know, but, I have to say, the cost of that training, &nbsp;
the development and delivery, were incredibly high&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.960
for all the community-based trainers. All of&nbsp;
us had... There were sessions we couldn’t do,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.200
because they’re vicious to each other,&nbsp;
the police. And they are... You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.360
there are a lot of people in there that really&nbsp;
like having a gun and a badge and probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.760
shouldn’t have one. And the kinds of things&nbsp;
that, you know, you have to listen to on repeat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.829
course after course after course, or workshop&nbsp;
after workshop. You know, it wears.

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.429
But I do want to contrast that

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:41.560
with the hallway conversations.&nbsp;The hallway 
conversations were amazing. One-on-one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.320
interaction with all the students, they were&nbsp;
fantastic. They would identify their favourite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.280
colour in real. They would speak to me like I was&nbsp;
human. [laughs] Because remember, they hated this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.240
right? They were forced, and no one likes to be&nbsp;
forced to do anything. Right? Before they’ve even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.520
met me, or before they’ve even tackled the topic,&nbsp;
there was a certain hatred. It was nerve-wracking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.755
at first, but as I became more comfortable&nbsp;
with them, I kind of learned how to navigate.
