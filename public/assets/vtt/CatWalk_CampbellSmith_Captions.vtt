00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
Because of my drag persona, I had a signature&nbsp;
outfit that I liked to wear. Leather pants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.880
with a fringe, a long fringe, really soft&nbsp;
ones. A cowboy shirt made of leather and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.120
probably a black tank top right underneath,&nbsp;
zipped-up and hidden. And perhaps, usually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.320
a cowboy hat. And they weren’t tight leather&nbsp;
pants, like... There were only two pairs ever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.380
made. They were Wayne Clark’s, who was a Canadian&nbsp;
Designer, quite famous Canadian Designer. And he’d&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.180
made two pairs, and my dad happened to get&nbsp;
one of them at an auction. And at some point,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.360
he gifted them to me, and they were just the&nbsp;
most comfortable things. But I would have dragged&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.380
up to. So, with sideburns. I wanted to still&nbsp;
have that, like, “here I am as your bartender,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.720
but I’m special tonight. And I’m here&nbsp;
to entertain you a little bit.” Greeting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.700
people with enthusiasm. You know, just getting&nbsp;
into the spirit. Everybody was in such a good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.220
mood and having such a wonderful time, and,&nbsp;
yeah, I wanted to, kind of like, amp it up.
