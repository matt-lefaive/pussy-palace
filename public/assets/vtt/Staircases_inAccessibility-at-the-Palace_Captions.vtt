00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.130
We could never have a freaking bathhouse that
was accessible to people who used wheelchairs.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:05.794
You know?

00:00:05.794 --> 00:00:07.399
Or people who used mobility devices.

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:10.309
Because the fucking places, every single one
has a set of stairs.

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.825
There’s so many stairs at Club Toronto.

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:13.450
Oh, my goodness.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.000
Yeah.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.907
And that was a function of men’s bathhouses

00:00:16.907 --> 00:00:19.770
that were more accessible being unwilling to share space.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.448
You know, we ended up with a Thursday night
at Club Toronto because it’s the slowest night.

00:00:23.448 --> 00:00:25.110
You know, they weren’t making money anyway.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.860
And so, this was a way for them to make money.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.640
But at the places that probably had a steadier income,
or weren’t as reliant on an influx of cash,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.649
were just not interested in sharing space
for a night with women.

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:45.230
We did have one person who used to come in
a wheelchair, and we had volunteers to help

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.650
them get around.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.199
Couple people could pick them up and take
them to a different floor, I remember.
