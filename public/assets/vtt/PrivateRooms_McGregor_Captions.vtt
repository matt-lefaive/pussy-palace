00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.370
So, I was seeing someone at the time.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.149
And both of us, although we were in consensual
open relationships, it was hard to figure

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:09.340
out where to connect.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.217
There wasn’t an easy way to have privacy.

00:00:12.217 --> 00:00:18.000
So, when we found out about Pussy Palace,
we were like, “Oh yeah, we need to go to

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.039
that together and get a private room, and...”

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:28.341
I remember there sort of being a contrast
between the energy and the physical space.

00:00:28.341 --> 00:00:34.780
Like, in our room, the walls were very hard,
the bed was kind of small, and, if I remember

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.370
rightly, it had a gym mat kind of feeling
to it.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.210
It just felt very…

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.590
Mercenary isn’t the right word, but, like,
pared down.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.960
And I didn’t care.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.379
But I think that there was sort of this need
to accept that this is what it is, this is

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:51.379
what’s possible.

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.469
But there was, like, an excitement too.

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:01.100
It had that feeling of: you’re in a very
intentional space, you’re anticipating what’s

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.189
going to happen, and it seems like anything
could happen.

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.170
And I also have the feeling that there was
some kind of thing where other people were

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.000
waiting for the room, or there was a limited
number of rooms.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.800
And so, we were conscious of the longer we
held that room, the less chance someone else would have.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.337
So, I think that, at some point, we turned
in our key so someone else could use the room.

00:01:23.337 --> 00:01:24.842
It was very special.

00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:26.930
Yes, the room could have been cushier.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.530
Like, if every room had been like a hotel
room, or whatever.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.600
But it just felt like you couldn’t get more
perfect, in terms of feeling like you were

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.653
inside this womb space that was protected.

00:01:39.653 --> 00:01:40.760
It was fantastic.
