00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:05.516
One thing that always struck me about the
bathhouses is that women and people who are

00:00:05.516 --> 00:00:10.780
socialized female approach sex a lot differently
than I think gay men do.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.940
There was quite a bit of socializing, talking
and feeling each other out.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:22.010
I think every women-and-trans sex party that
I’ve been to, not just at the bathhouse,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.554
there’s always this beginning part of socializing
where there needs to be some talking, hanging out

00:00:27.554 --> 00:00:29.130
and hugging and “Hey, how are you?

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.130
What have you been up to?”

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.130
And just, sort of a...

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.340
Yeah, like a connecting point.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.530
I think sometimes in our minds, you know,
when you think about what’s going to happen,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.860
you think you’re just going to arrive and
you’re going to grab someone and you’re

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.050
just going to go shove them in a corner.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.813
And that would be great, but that’s not
really the way that you get a date.

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:47.701
[laughs]

00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:53.043
It’s friendly, but there is this
undercurrent of tension, of sexiness.

00:00:53.043 --> 00:00:53.730
Something’s going to happen.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.177
And people are talking, but they’re looking
around.

00:00:56.177 --> 00:00:56.690
Right?

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.690
They’re like, “Who’s here?

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.391
Who am I going to follow?

00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:00.140
Who’s looking at me?

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.919
Is anyone looking at me?”

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:05.414
Everyone and everything just seems so hot.

00:01:05.414 --> 00:01:08.390
The whole thing was just hot, hot, hot.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.420
And I’m not sure at the time I would say
it in these words, but I think everyone felt it,

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.290
that what was happening was sort of unique
and precious.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.530
This was not something that was going to happen
all the time.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.920
And so, I think this feeling of just wanting
to grab this moment.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.827
Despite any anxiety or trepidation, just wanting
to just jump in and just be in it.
