00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.160
There was both a human rights complaint and&nbsp;
a class action lawsuit that essentially got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:11.677
rolled into one. And we were contacted at some&nbsp;
point to ask if we would be part of the class&nbsp;action suit.

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:16.800
I don’t know specifically how it&nbsp;happened, 
but someone contacted us and said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.488
“We’re going to go forward with a class&nbsp;action lawsuit.
This isn’t right. We need&nbsp;four plaintiffs to do it."&nbsp;

00:00:23.488 --> 00:00:27.246
And because Ange&nbsp;[Beever] and I 
were self-employed and didn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.246 --> 00:00:32.680
feel that our livelihoods would be in jeopardy,&nbsp;
we said we would do it because it was something we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.800
could do to help our community, so that we could&nbsp;
represent the class of women who were there that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.000
night. I was really glad that we did it. We met&nbsp;
a couple of really awesome lawyers, Bonnie Tough,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.400
who has since passed away, and she was formidable.&nbsp;
And then Kathryn Podrebarac was her co-counsel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.520
They were great. And Richard [Aitcheson] and JP&nbsp;
[Hornick] were the other two named plaintiffs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.910
who had been on the Special Occasion Permit.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.720
I&nbsp;don’t remember going to the court for that.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.551
I feel like the lawyers were working with the&nbsp;
negotiation with the police’s officers.

00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:07.680
We were not essentially in charge of arguing&nbsp;
things. We weren’t the policy makers for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.040
lack of a better term. They asked for money that&nbsp;
would go to the, I believe it was called Bill 7,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.560
the scholarship fund that the bar was originally&nbsp;
benefiting, and Maggie’s, the sex workers outreach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.920
group. Because, again, it was about policing&nbsp;
women’s sexuality, and Maggie’s, I know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.349
had been very helpful to the bathhouse committee&nbsp;
organizers, both before and after the police raid.
