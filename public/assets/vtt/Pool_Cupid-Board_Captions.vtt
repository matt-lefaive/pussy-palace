00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.280
I remember there being a cupid board, which
I thought was kind of fun.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.300
You could put a number on your chest and then
people would write, like, love note things.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.810
And there was an area, a board where...

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.960
And you’d look throughout the night.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.582
“Did someone send me a note?”

00:00:14.582 --> 00:00:20.602
I think I made a joke in my column, at the
time, that it was all very polite as opposed to...

00:00:20.602 --> 00:00:28.041
As a commentary on, culturally, female sexuality
versus male sexuality being a little more

00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:35.660
overt and less polite and empathetic, whereas
I felt the environment there was very inclusive

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.680
and feel-good.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.750
These aren’t spaces that were...

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:47.739
That women and trans folk were used to, invited
into, had long-standing mores and cultural

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.510
practices or norms around.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.180
And so, having to establish those from the
ground up, I really commend the committee

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.510
for a lot of what they were pretty forward-thinking
in what they were trying to do.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.719
And some people had like...

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:06.350
People who were involved in the leather community,
sure, already knew what to do in these spaces,

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.830
or had a sense of what they wanted to do with
this kind of space.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.900
But I really think that it was something different,
that the committee didn’t just take that

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.070
for granted, you know?

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:24.000
That they really tried to anticipate and make
it feel good, like a space that people could reclaim.
