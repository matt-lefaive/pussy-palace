00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.560
Straight people were very supportive, and I think&nbsp;
there are complex political reasons for that. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.240
think that they envisioned queer women, queer, cis&nbsp;
women, as safe in a way that they absolutely would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.720
not have when the raids happened on gay men’s&nbsp;
events, or if we had been trans women, or if more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.624
of us had been Black or Indigenous. It would not&nbsp;
have been seen as positively.

00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:25.492
It would have been seen as more threatening.

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:28.600
And I’m not quite sure&nbsp;how they got onto it 
exactly this way, but it got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:35.160
spun as a kind of, like, a high-level panty raid.&nbsp;
It’s sort of like the male police officers go into,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.920
like, a women’s locker room where they shouldn’t&nbsp;
be. I remember thinking at that time, it’s like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.200
my friends’ grandmothers could be outraged&nbsp;
by what the police did, not thinking about,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.880
you know, well, the women were there to have&nbsp;
sex. But it was more like, you know, it’s these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.520
nice women and girls, and the men, the police,&nbsp;
shouldn’t be there.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.200
‘Cause, you know, people

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:00.280
have a hard time conceptualizing of, like, women&nbsp;
having sex with each other, aside from a kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.840
like, either a porn version or a sort of gentle&nbsp;
“lie on your sides and touch each other gently”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.760
kind of thing. There’s no realistic perception&nbsp;
of, like, anything in between. [chuckles] So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.440
I think [w]hat actually played in our favour to a&nbsp;
large extent was sexism. There’s this widespread&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.000
perception that the cops had overstepped.&nbsp;
Like, there wasn’t the public outcry when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.520
they raided the Barn and the Bijou, for example,&nbsp;
because it turns out saying “slurp ramp” versus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.696
“women’s bathhouse” has two different, you&nbsp;
know, frequencies in the social discourse.
