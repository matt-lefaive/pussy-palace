00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.760
We struggled through all these different ways&nbsp;
of increasing inclusion and diversity. It was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:12.920
really hard to do all that, and then it wasn’t&nbsp;
very successful. Folks that I knew just really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.120
were not that interested, or they would show&nbsp;
up and they would feel very out of place and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:25.120
kind of uncomfortable. And kind of just only hang&nbsp;
around each other and then not come back. And so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.240
at some point I became quite burnt out. It was&nbsp;
probably around that time that I was debating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.520
like, “What am I going to do? How do I tell my&nbsp;
committee that it was actually ill-suited?” I’m&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.720
not a great committee member for hosting&nbsp;
a bathhouse. I just really believe in it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.720
but it’s not my strength. And so, there was a lot&nbsp;
of things we were doing that I felt kind of out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.000
my league. And many of the people who were on the&nbsp;
committee are very connected, well-established,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.760
white queer women who, kind of, run in similar&nbsp;
circles. And so, they would be very competent at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.280
a lot of things that I wasn’t. And so, I actually&nbsp;
think I was struggling myself to really see my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.480
worth, to really feel well used. I was planning on&nbsp;
quitting shortly after the raid, and then the raid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.520
happened, so it, kind of, delayed. So, I don’t&nbsp;
really know when my official resignation was,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.920
and I don’t really think it mattered that&nbsp;
much. Because I was already quite apart. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.560
I think I felt really torn, and I felt really&nbsp;
ashamed that I wasn’t a better organizer. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:46.120
want to be a very good one. And I think I&nbsp;
had the belief that it was really a game or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.800
an experience that’s much more meant for the type&nbsp;
of personality that was same as some of the more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:04.360
dominant members. Femme, top, tall, established,&nbsp;
personable, vivacious, extrovert. And so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.480
I just felt like a little brown, quiet mouse&nbsp;
on the side. That was my experience because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:18.240
it just echoed some experiences from my past. I&nbsp;
don’t think it itself was exactly that. I could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:28.080
have been a different person and thrived and been&nbsp;
contributive in a significant way. I just didn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.160
know how to thrive in that environment. I wrote&nbsp;
a resignation letter, and I read it to the group.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:43.480
And it was cathartic enough to just tell the&nbsp;
truth to the group, and say, “I feel small here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.760
and I don’t like it, and I don’t want to. This&nbsp;
is hard and it was harder than I expected,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.960
but I needed to do this and thank you.” And&nbsp;
also, “I don’t know if this is going to work;”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.460
a women’s bathhouse, or a women-and-trans&nbsp;
bathhouse, that isn’t primarily white.
