00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880
You know, looking back, I would say, “Well,&nbsp;
that was really naive of us.” And in fact,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:09.000
we should have always been prepared for that.&nbsp;
We’re an easy target. And certainly, there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.680
some really vulnerable folks, more vulnerable&nbsp;
than I would, per se, be. In terms of privilege,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.520
I am a white, cisgendered female. [smiling]&nbsp;
Middle-class now. Certainly, older. Don’t get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.360
the kind of harassment that people of colour&nbsp;
do, particularly Black folks and Indigenous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:32.600
folks. And it was... Is a mistake of ours, not to&nbsp;
actually think of that in advance. If I look back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.920
I would go, “Mm.” You know, pretty much everybody&nbsp;
that was leading the committee that evening were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:46.000
white. And I think if we started to be&nbsp;
worried about the involvement of cops,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.960
it would’ve been really important for us&nbsp;
to actually seek the leadership of BIPOC&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.200
folks in terms of the preparation for that, or at&nbsp;
least talk to folks and say, “This might happen,”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.120
so that there was some knowledge going in. And,&nbsp;
“These are the things that we do.” And “What would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.966
you need?” So that’s the kind of stuff that I&nbsp;
think about now, that we didn’t think about then.
