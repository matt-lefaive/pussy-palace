00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.300
I see a DJ.

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.859
I keep thinking that there was kind of a not
nice carpet on the floor.

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:14.150
And I think that there was encouraging, welcoming
signs everywhere, so there’s a lot of paper.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.181
[laughs]

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.330
I feel like a lot of people were drinking.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.915
I liked sober sex more.

00:00:19.915 --> 00:00:21.880
But I’m not sure if I knew that yet.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.400
For me, there’s always a little bit of apprehension
when lots of people are drunk.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.076
I think that alcohol was definitely something
I could both smell and sense.

00:00:31.076 --> 00:00:33.833
So, you see lots of women dancing.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:36.099
Really unaware of anything going on.

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:38.939
Lots of music, laughter.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:42.590
A little chlorine [laughs] because it was right beside
the pool.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.590
But sex.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.590
The whole place.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.850
You could sort of smell sex.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.340
You’ve got to understand, it was packed. Like,
it was just packed.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.676
You had people who were half naked, or just
wearing a towel around their waist.

00:00:53.676 --> 00:00:55.469
Right? And a pair of flip flops.

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.801
Or just totally naked.

00:00:56.801 --> 00:00:59.500
So, when you’re out at a bar, there’s always
music, right?

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.680
Like, loud thumping music.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.120
And so, you don’t have the same sonic sense
of a hundred women in a space or 200, 300.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.650
There, the music was lower.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.400
It wasn’t a dance club.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.060
The standout thing for me is the sound of
that many women having a really good time.
