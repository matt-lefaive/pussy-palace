00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.280
I don’t even know if I would have participated&nbsp;
in this now. I’m not sure. I mean, I’ve always&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.400
believed you work inside, you work outside,&nbsp;
right? To change things. Certainly, if we’re&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:16.160
stuck with it, let’s make sure it’s working&nbsp;
as best as we can get it. But around policing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.240
I don’t know. I don’t know if it’s worth putting&nbsp;
any energy into that from the inside, honestly. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.680
still... If I get a call from the city auditor,&nbsp;
I still see the value in having that meeting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:35.120
and talking and bringing that de-task/defund&nbsp;
abolitionist perspective. Because if you don’t,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.240
they won’t think of it. The Women’s Bathhouse&nbsp;
Committee was always also more radical than all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.080
of this, if that makes sense. In other words, I&nbsp;
don’t think they were fooled into thinking that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.840
this was a reformable institution either. It’s&nbsp;
just that you use whatever tools that you’ve got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.360
to hold them accountable because you cannot let&nbsp;
this pass. They cannot get away with that shit, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.481
you’ve got to use the tools that are&nbsp;
available to you to hold them accountable.
