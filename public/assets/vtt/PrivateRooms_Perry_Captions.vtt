00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:02.110
Someone was getting fucked.

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:09.410
I don’t know, fisted or with a dildo, so
I had to stop and, you know, check it out,

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:10.980
and check them out.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.822
I had my Magic Wand, so I was offering it.

00:00:14.822 --> 00:00:20.360
And also, I invited myself to watch.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.748
And I was more a voyeur.

00:00:21.748 --> 00:00:24.708
Like, I wouldn’t just watch without asking.

00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:29.580
Yeah, voyeurism has to be consensual or very
clandestine.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.791
It would have been nice if there was more
BDSM going on at those events.

00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:37.924
It’s more interesting, for me, anyway.

00:00:37.924 --> 00:00:43.780
Like, to watch people using equipment, and
just doing all kinds of things.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.480
Like, it’s so amazing to watch.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.756
It’s like trust and love.

00:00:50.756 --> 00:00:57.050
You know, love of the person’s body, and
wanting to give them an experience, like,

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.278
an ecstatic experience.

00:00:59.278 --> 00:01:03.018
That’s more something that I would be into.

00:01:03.018 --> 00:01:06.380
First, I think I have to feel some kind of
connection.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.090
But not necessarily, like, a big, heavy, deep
one, or...

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.630
You read body language too.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.490
You know, you watch somebody’s response,
so you touch them in a certain way, or with

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.130
a certain thing.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.770
And I always like to start really slowly and
sort of subtly.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.737
Trying to connect with where they are, what
they’re feeling.

00:01:29.737 --> 00:01:33.501
What they want to feel more, or less.

00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:36.030
You know, and they go somewhere.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.394
And connection.

00:01:37.394 --> 00:01:39.028
Connecting with everything.

00:01:39.028 --> 00:01:41.240
It’s like a language, or something.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.360
Or a dance you’re doing together, and I
think it’s great.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.509
But, you know, the Pussy Palace is different.

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.750
And a lot of times people they want to just
maybe consume.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.750
They want to consume.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.323
And you’re not going to have a real sensitive…

00:01:54.323 --> 00:01:58.041
But I think it was a very good thing those
particular events.
