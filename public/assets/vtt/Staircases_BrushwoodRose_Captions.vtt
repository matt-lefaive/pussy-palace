00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.253
What I remember is carpet,

00:00:03.253 --> 00:00:05.253
narrow hallways,

00:00:05.253 --> 00:00:07.687
and staircases going up.

00:00:07.687 --> 00:00:10.360
Like, it’s a tall structure.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.360
No windows, right?

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.970
Like, completely windowless.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.029
So, just, any lighting was kept very dim.

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.320
Presumably that’s part of what people are
going there for, is the dim lighting.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.869
I mean, it kind of felt dungeon-y, except
that it was not that cool.

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.960
It was really, like, wood panelling, and carpet.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.519
Like, it didn’t strike me as super clean,
but we didn’t care about that really.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.454
I mean, every hallway kind of looked the same,
and...

00:00:33.454 --> 00:00:36.200
It’s like the timeless, dark…

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.700
Who knows what time…?

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.309
It could be 7:00 a.m. in the morning.

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.490
You have no idea.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.565
There were none of the typical markers that
helped guide you through a space.
