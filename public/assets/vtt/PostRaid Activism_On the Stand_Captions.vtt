00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.880
I just remember being very nervous. You know,&nbsp;
wanting to make sure that my testimony was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.600
relevant, and that I... I’ve testified before in&nbsp;
other situations, and, you know, the goal is to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.040
trip you up. It’s easy to sit and talk to your&nbsp;
own lawyer. It was actually being cross-examined&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.600
that I was nervous about. I have no memory of&nbsp;
what I was asked, although we prepped before,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.362
I have no memory at all.

00:00:25.362 --> 00:00:28.426
Their questions&nbsp;were so ridiculous.

00:00:28.426 --> 00:00:29.651
They were like… You know,

00:00:29.651 --> 00:00:38.320
“If you’re all lesbians, what difference does it&nbsp;
make if some men see you naked?” [Laughs]. It just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:45.080
didn’t... It didn’t make any sense to me at all.&nbsp;
And then I had to, for some reason, reveal that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:52.560
was bisexual. And that felt like the ultimate slap&nbsp;
in the face because this was the thing that I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.160
never quite comfortable with. But because of the&nbsp;
questions that this lawyer was asking, I felt like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.800
I had to say… “Well, I’m bisexual, and of course I&nbsp;
care who sees me naked either way. Not that, that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.720
has anything to do with my sexuality.” I mean, I&nbsp;
wish I could say it was like this great moment of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.880
self-acceptance; it wasn’t. I feel like I put&nbsp;
it out there because the question demanded it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.480
and it felt like a “fuck you.” Like, I was able to&nbsp;
use it in a way that brought us some power back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.680
At some point, someone was describing seeing&nbsp;
a woman in a room with cops surrounding her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.580
and they were talking about me.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.548
[silence]

00:01:35.548 --> 00:01:36.671
One second.

00:01:36.671 --> 00:01:40.134
[silence]

00:01:40.134 --> 00:01:44.200
It always makes me emotional because in the time

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.160
between when the raid happened and the court&nbsp;
case, I remember telling the story, like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:56.720
a hundred times to people; it was a thing to talk&nbsp;
about in the community. And the way we told the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.480
story was very much that defiant, like, “You’re&nbsp;
not going to get us.” And, “Yeah.” You know? And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:09.280
the anger at their actions had kind of carried&nbsp;
through that storytelling, and then hearing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.720
someone describe me as looking terrified... It&nbsp;
actually... I was like, “Oh my God, I was scared.”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:23.440
I forgot I was scared. I had, kind of, repressed&nbsp;
that or just pushed it aside to deal with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.091
injustice of it. But hearing someone talk about&nbsp;
me, it completely brought all that stuff back.
