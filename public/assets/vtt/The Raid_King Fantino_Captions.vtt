00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.280
I remember I went to the press conference&nbsp;
where they announced his appointment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.240
and it was just like a new king had&nbsp;
been anointed. But then, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.120
because I had worked at Xtra, I was aware&nbsp;
that there had been controversy about him. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.640
we were very much on the watch for him. Like, I&nbsp;
felt like we were waiting for something to happen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.600
in a way, because he seemed to have, I guess,&nbsp;
prejudices against the LGBT community based&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.960
on what he was doing in London [Ontario]. He&nbsp;
held a reception on Church Street for Pride,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.280
which again was a big surprise. It was just...&nbsp;
Seemed like a bit of a public relations thing to,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.000
kind of, make good with the community. And some&nbsp;
people actually protested that reception. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.680
remember the guest list of that reception was very&nbsp;
strange. Like, Xtra wasn’t invited. People that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.960
you would’ve thought would have been invited,&nbsp;
weren’t invited. It seemed to have been a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.720
curated list. So, that was that summer, and then&nbsp;
the Pussy Palace happened in the fall. Not that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.000
we expected the Pussy Palace raid, I think that&nbsp;
itself came as a surprise, but I think we were,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.640
kind of, waiting for some shoe to drop, that&nbsp;
the police were going to do something because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.412
there’s just a suspicion that [Julian] Fantino&nbsp;
had aggressive thoughts towards LGBT people.
